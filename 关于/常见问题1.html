Frequently Asked Questions

The Sovereign Integral is the transparent Being of Expansion, uniquely fit for the era in which we have begun to enter. – James

Since its launch, the WingMakers’ website has elicited a variety of reactions, perhaps none so persistent as to the enigma of its creator, and why I seek anonymity. I invite you to examine the materials contained within this website, less concerned with who created the materials and why, and more focused on how to apply them in your personal life, provided they resonate with your inmost self.

If you read my responses to the questions posed by members of the WingMakers’ discussion forum and various students, you will gain insight into my purpose, and if you read carefully, you will understand why these materials exist as they do. In this short introduction, I will try to provide additional insight into these materials and their purpose.

Within the last century, contemporary belief systems have rightly placed their focus on love, and more specifically, love that is divine, unconditional and freely shared among all people regardless of their place in the social order. The greatest teachers of humanity have professed this same sentiment, but love remains one of the most misunderstood concepts of humanity.

Love is a fundamental action that, in itself, is not sufficient to bring a species into alignment with the purpose and objectives of First Source or God. While love serves a vital function in coalescing humanity and healing its self-inflicted wounds, it is the knowledge and rightful application of new sciences that will reveal the human soul to the mind of humanity. And it is this revelation that will bring humanity – as a collective species – into conscious alignment with the purpose of First Source.

The WingMakers incarnate as humans from time-to-time in order to bring its teachings directly to humanity. The WingMakers have been known by many different names throughout the history of humankind, but always they have been involved in bringing spiritual culture and science to the developing mind of humanity. The purpose of this endeavor is to spark or catalyze the discovery of the human soul – not through the subjective lens of metaphysics or religion, but through the irrefutable application of scientific principle.

These collected works are aspects of this process. I am a translator of these works that originate from a different spatial or dimensional level known as a Tributary Zone. These works are catalytic and intended to help individuals shift their consciousness in order to more effectively access their own spiritual purpose, particularly as it relates to the discovery of the Grand Portal.

The Grand Portal is a term we use to describe the irrefutable scientific discovery of the human soul. It is an event that humanity is steadily nearing, and its arrival is estimated to be near the time 2080. These materials, and others like them, will be catalysts for those incarnating souls who are part of the Grand Portal discovery.

I can appreciate that this may seem like science fiction to many of you, but it is nonetheless an impending reality, and marks a profound shift in the fundamental social structures of humanity. The discovery of the Grand Portal is literally a portal into a new multi-dimensional universe that demonstrates that humanity is not an isolated “patch” of life, but rather part of an amazingly diverse assemblage of life forms that span multiple universes and dimensions.

It is not unlike when oceanographers first began to survey the ocean’s depths and discovered new species of life where it was thought impossible for life to exist. According to our estimates, a similar phenomenon – but at a much more profound level – will occur in about 80 years as science and soul collide, and the reality of a near-infinite variety of life forms beyond the physical dimension is discovered and shared with all of humanity.

The belief systems upon earth will undergo calamitous change following the discovery of the Grand Portal as the new sciences – above all, particle physics and molecular biology – begin to dramatically restructure the social institutions of religion, government, education, and culture. This is the discovery that humanity has been evolving towards for the past 11,000 years.

I am here to help in this discovery. If you apply these materials in your own life, you are as well.

From my world to yours,

James

● Where, or from whom, does the material for the WingMakers’ materials originate?

The exact source of the material remains a mystery. However, an individual by the name of “James Mahu” has, as of February of 2001, stepped forward as the sole creator of all the content contained on this site. More can be learned about James’ identity and purpose by reading or listening to the audio of his interviews within the Creator section of the website. The History page of the Introduction section on the WingMakers.com website is another good place to learn the back story of how these materials came to be. Perhaps the best insight is in the book called the Collected Works of the WingMakers Vol. 1.


When did the WingMakers website launch?
November 23, 1998, 11:00 pm Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).


Is WingMakers a cult?

No. There are no memberships, no organization, no requirements, no inner circle, no central doctrine, no leadership, no buildings, no meetings, no board of directors, and no personality that lends its charisma to generate tithing members. James Mahu has been very specific about keeping WingMakers low key, underground, sober, agnostic and personal. There is no fanfare. WingMakers.com sends out updates 2-3 times a year about new content, and that’s it.

Why did James decide to write novels, instead of writing everything in a nonfiction orientation like other gurus or experts in the metaphysical space?

James creates mythological environments where deep spiritual content can be assimilated by the reader through the activation of their imagination, and fictional settings provide the best way to achieve this. Fiction allows the reader to consider the possibilities, but not see the writings as being absolute or authoritative. It provides exploration without the feelings of indoctrination.

The WingMakers Materials are ancient. They are not owned by any organization and certainly not any individual. In James’ view, they should be represented as pure as they are—without embellishments or personality or organizational imprints of any kind. They are agnostic in terms of their orientation towards any existing religion or spiritual belief. They are not self-help or personal development materials. They are catalysts for the Sovereign Integral state of consciousness.

Is there an organization behind the WingMakers Materials?

No. James has been determined not to create any kind of organization that would promote his works, or try to organize followers into some kind of church or membership, or position him as some kind of spiritual leader that other should follow. The materials he has shared are for the individual. The frequencies and nuance of his writings, art, music, poetry, videos, etc. are part of a larger initiative he has called “The Grand Portal.”

The Grand Portal is the irrefutable, scientific discovery of the human soul. James has written extensively about this discovery and references can be found throughout his materials. His recent novel, Quantusum, paints a very clear picture of this incredible discovery and its implications. Many of the Lyricus materials also define The Grand Portal in some detail.

Why does the WingMakers website sell products?

There is a significant cost to produce music CDs, books, art prints, etc. and there is global demand for James’ works. People from all over the globe (89 countries at last count) sense the special nature of these materials, and have ordered products. As it has been said so many times, “Content is king.” Content is one of the primary things that people consume to help them find meaning in their lives. James has imbued his content with a specific kind of frequency that many people—even subconsciously—identify as catalytic and transformative. They want the high resolution files of this content, and this carries a cost.

No one is making large sums of money. WingMakers is not designed or scaled to be a big business; it’s designed to be a service to the enlightenment community, and hopefully break even. That’s the extent of it. The web manager (Mark Hempel) and his wife handle all of the email, packaging of orders, inventory management, working with vendors, accounting, etc. And they do this out of their house.

For what it’s worth, there are no companies involved in these materials. No publisher is in the middle of these materials directing them this way or that, trying to make them more “marketable” to the general public. This is very common for materials of this kind and quality. Publishers, studios, producers, distributors, retailers, agents, etc. insert themselves into the creative process and try to make the materials more commercially successful.

It is a simple process: James provides the materials; his web manager posts them on the website and handles the fulfillment to the end-customer. That’s it—the sum total. Many companies, large and small, have approached WingMakers, seeking to commercialize these materials, and James has rejected every proposal. James is not motivated by money. If he were, he would have pursued some of these commercial proposals.

Where should I start with these materials? They are so vast. What’s the best place to start?

It might be a good idea to scan the materials and sample various elements and see what resonates to your heart and mind. The Ancient Arrow Project book is considered by most WingMakers aficionados to be the centerpiece of the work, and a great starting point. It provides the best foundation for the other materials, but there’s no right or wrong way.

How many people have been to the website?

Approximately 7.9 million visits since its launch, but it’s impossible to say how many repeat visits there were. A better estimate would be about 1,450,000 unique visitors (from all across the globe) have come to the website since it launched, and this interest has been generated without a single dime spent on marketing or promotion.

Can the text be printed and distributed?

Yes, the text and paintings can be printed for individual use, but not for commercial purposes. The materials are all protected under copyright. Thus, it’s okay for individuals to print out the text for their own enjoyment, but you cannot legally distribute these materials for commercial purposes.

I ran across a philosophy paper attributed to the WingMakers. Are there more of the chamber philosophies in the public domain than are on the website?

Within the WingMakers.com site is the full, original content that has been released. Everything you will find on this site is from James and represents the content he has made public. This content is the only authentic WingMakers’ Material, and it is copyright protected by the Library of Congress. Any information attributed to the WingMakers that does not have the copyright notification should be deemed potentially inauthentic, and if it is not found within WingMakers.com, Lyricus.org, EventTemples.com, SovereignIntegral.org, or SpiritState.com (all official sites of James Mahu), then it is possibly inauthentic or has been modified. Many people have purported to be officials of Lyricus or representatives of James, but James is not represented by anyone.

The closest relationship James has—with regard to a company—is Planetwork Press, his publisher. He also has several of his novels published digitally on Sumbola.com.

There are emails attributed to Mark Hempel that claim he wrote the materials for the purpose of creating a movie or an Immersive Multimedia Art Form (IMAF). Is this true?

There were at least 10 emails that were attributed to me (Mark Hempel) that I’m aware of. All of these postings and emails appeared shortly after the WingMakers website was launched in November 1998. One claimed that the site was a hoax. Another claimed I was taking credit for creating all of the content. A third made the claim that I had developed the material to launch a movie. A fourth advanced the notion that I had developed an experimental art form called an IMAF. The rest were of a similar nature. In any case, I didn’t write these emails, nor do I know who did, or for what purpose someone was impersonating me. In 1998 (even today) it was a very simple task to impersonate someone using email.

When the WingMakers site was launched, it caused a flurry of activity because James had launched a powerful event string in terms of his content. It was like throwing a large boulder into a calm lake. The content was anonymous. It was integrated in an unusual way. It had insights into the secret government that many experts have corroborated. Even many of its predictions proved to be true. There were many evidences that elements of our government didn’t want certain features of these materials released… like the Neruda Interviews.

Are there any study groups for the WingMakers Materials?

If you go to the WingMakers Study Group website you can learn about the study groups that exist, and even access the materials to start your own. This site is not affiliated with James or his materials, but the people involved are enthusiasts of the WingMakers Materials and have chosen to share their experience in creating study groups.

It seems that now that James Mahu has announced his name and has done interviews, he can’t be considered “anonymous” anymore. I guess my question is: is this really James’ identity and is it true that only one person put this massive amount of content together by themselves?

James remains anonymous. It is his choice to do so. While he has provided a name, no one should assume it is his real name. As to your other question, yes, James has said that all of the WingMakers content is generated by him, but he is “translating” this from other dimensions. That is to say, he’s tuning into frequencies that he can see and hear, and then bringing these into physical manifestation using current tools, technologies and techniques. It isn’t an artistic expression. It is a mission. That mission, on a personal level, is to create catalytic tools for people to begin to lift their behavioral intelligence and journey a little closer to the next evolution of awareness that James refers to as the Sovereign Integral state of consciousness. On the social level, they are signposts and memes to lead humanity to The Grand Portal.


Why did you decide to publish your work through Mark Hempel at the South Bay Group, as you have not met him personally?

My associate, Sarah, knew of Mark through a mutual contact. He was recommended as someone who was discrete and trustworthy, and possessed the technical skill necessary to launch and maintain the website, as well as the other technical projects that will be introduced in the future. I also wanted to publish through an individual like Mark, instead of a company, in order to ensure total control over the project.

How can you entrust such a large piece of work to a total stranger—someone whose integrity is unknown to you?

I think I mostly answered this question in my previous response, but I’ll add that I have trust in people who perform consistently over time. I watched how Mark handled everything from the very start, and it wasn’t until six months into the relationship that I began to entrust him with significant responsibility. He earned my trust, it wasn’t instantly granted.

What is the purpose of introducing Sarah de Rosnay as a ‘middle man’ between yourself and Mark?

Sarah enables me to concentrate on content creation and teaching. She also answers much of the mail I receive and supports Mark in his work on the front-lines.

Is the story factually correct, apart from places, names and dates?

The story I assume you’re referring to is the ACIO and Ancient Arrow site. This part of the story is based on fact. I won’t divulge how I know these things, but it certainly isn’t difficult to ascertain if you’ve studied the story in any detail. There are techniques that can be applied to secure the information.

All we get from governments is half-truths about ufos, aliens, cover-ups etc. Isn’t this just more of the same?

The WingMakers’ information set isn’t intended to be a revelation about the government suppression of UFOs and extraterrestrials. There’s ample information about this already, and there are more focused and competent organizations researching this arena than I. The WingMakers’ material is concerned with the human discovery of the human soul in irrefutable, scientific terms. This is its exclusive focal point. All the other elements, be they of the story or art or mathematics are designed to be catalytic to those who will come in the future to make this discovery manifest and enduring. It is to these that this material is dedicated, and it will draw them as assuredly as a magnificent tree draws the eagle to nest.
[Here James is referring to The Grand Portal discovery and those who will contribute to that discovery. Ed.](All Ed. remarks are written by John Berges.)

You said, “The WingMakers have been communicating with humans for approximately eleven thousand years.” Why is this material being released now? Is it related to the freedom of speech given to the individual via the Internet—at last mankind can speak in freedom to all on the globe and totally bypass the lies, propaganda and deception fed to us by corrupt governments?

The Tributary Zones are being released now because within the next three generations of SECUs (Sovereign Entity of the Central Universe) being born upon earth are the representatives that will discover the Grand Portal, and the WingMakers’ mythology will be among the primary sensory data streams that catalyze their awakening.
The WingMakers observe a life-bearing planet via the same SBL technology I referred to earlier in your first two questions. [See Sensory Bi-location. Ed.] Using this insight, we can determine with a high degree of accuracy when a species is prepared to receive its acceleration, and when this time occurs, Lyricus deploys a team of teachers to the planet.

Approximately eleven thousand years ago, this team incarnated in physical, human bodies, and became earth’s first teachers of the higher sciences, arts, and metaphysics. I will not go into any further detail at this time, but these initial members of Lyricus placed in the Genetic Mind of the human race the purpose of discovering the Grand Portal. This purpose is dimly understood by the human species at this time, but it will become clear in approximately fifty years.

I don’t think the WingMakers’ materials (WMM) is necessarily directed at “esoteric students.” A much broader net is apparently being cast. Is this correct?

The WingMakers’ materials are not being aimed at any one group. It is more the reverse that there are certain groups and individuals that are being directed to the catalytic materials you refer to as WMM. Events strings are like mathematical algorithms that possess a resonance point that, when affected by a certain frequency, can induce a select individual or, to a lesser extent, an entire group, to unconsciously seek out the WMM. This inducement is like a subtle fragrance that draws you to a destination of a flower-covered field without your conscious desire to experience a flower.
It is true to say that the “broader net”, as you put it, is designed for those outside of the esoteric practices. This is simply because those steeped in the esoteric will often be instilled with a subtle, but nonetheless compelling, motive to protect the esoteric teachings that they hold true or at least most probable. Thus, the esoteric works of text left behind by former teachers activates their inspiration. When they are exposed to music, poetry, and art that are not directly connected to these esoteric texts, their protective reflex is invoked, and the material is not absorbed—it tends to be analyzed and compared.

The WMM is to be absorbed like one would absorb the sunshine when they are outside. No one requires measuring devices or lenses to absorb the sun’s rays; they simply need to be in the path of these rays. They need to position themselves to receive the sun. This is how it is with WMM. The broader net is really about the new souls incarnating who will, as a result of their encoded event strings, unconsciously position themselves to receive these materials.


Despite benefit to some, how can you in good conscience allow wingmakers.com’s continued catalyzing of people into New-Age-automatons?

The content of the WingMakers is not catalyzing automatons. It is quite the opposite; it is disconnecting people from the established fabric of the “New Age” and acquainting them to new energies that are present within themselves, not the “New Age.”

How are the WingMakers’ materials connected to the present-day belief systems on earth? Did they come first, last, or are they somehow inspirational to the other religions of humanity?

One of the most common features of the human mind is to compare one experience to another. It is reasoned—and rightly so by the mind—that by comparison of an object, experience, event or person, one can better understand it. However, in the case of the seven Tributary Zones this reasoning does not hold up.
The seven Tributary Zones, which we will call collectively, the WingMakers’ material, are not philosophical texts. There will be the temptation by some to compare these writings to the Bible, Qur’an, The Urantia Book, Ascended Master instructions, and on and on. There will be others who will compare the information contained in the interviews and book to the nonfiction works of investigative journalists. Comparison of the WingMakers’ materials will not necessarily result in understanding, but more likely, confusion.

The WingMakers’ materials are designed in a different way from anything that has ever been manifested on earth. It is a collection of encoded sensory data streams destined for a consumer technology platform that is just beginning to be incubated within development labs. However, even when experienced without this technology platform, the individual is aware that there is a deep transformation occurring. Something is “reshuffling” their mental “deck”.

I would encourage anyone who is immersing his or her consciousness in these materials to go without comparison for a period of time as they absorb these materials. The Tributary Zones have more information encoded in them than the human mind can access and comprehend. If an individual is engaged in comparison, they may not be engaged in the deeper meaning of the Tributary Zone, at the level where the encoded information is revealed.

Incidentally, what I’ve just said is not to imply that the encoded information must be wrested from the Tributary Zone by conscious will and effort. It is a delicate thing to detect the encoded information. It requires a supple intelligence, open mind, contemplative perspective, and the curiosity of calculated observation. It is not a battle of wills or mind over matter. And it is seldom revealed in the clutter of comparison.

As to the connection of the WingMakers’ material to the present-day belief systems of earth, there is little connection because these materials are not created by earth teachers, nor are they only the words of teachers. They are encoded sensory data stream from an extraterrestrial teaching order that have a very specific purpose. The present-day belief systems of earth serve a different and more general purpose of moral conditioning, community-building, and spiritual preparedness. Only in this last element is there any connection.


In the third interview with Dr. Neruda, there is a statement that there exists a Corteum technology to increase fluid intelligence to “super” human levels by inducing a functional cluster within the thalamocortical system. What is this functional cluster (electrical, biological), and could the WingMakers’ material (i.e. music, art, poetry) be used in such a fashion?

You have successfully touched on a subtle component of the WingMakers’ material. The story contains scenarios that are fictional accounts of factual occurrences. For example, as you point out, the third interview makes this disclosure about functional clusters, but the Corteum technology is a fictional account for the factual occurrence of how the WingMakers’ materials can—as depicted in the philosophy papers—stimulate functional clusters in certain regions of the brain.
The brain itself is divided into regions, and within the regions they are divided into subsets. Some subsets interact among themselves more than others, and these are called functional clusters. The brain is designed to have various circuits, of which contemporary brain researchers have identified three, which they call convergent, divergent, and reverberating circuits.

A functional cluster can have a divergent circuit that conducts neural activity to outlying regions of the brain or CNS. Sensory information (e.g., sounds, symbols, and images) can be produced that stimulates the temporal formation of just such a functional cluster within the thalamocortical system that catalyzes a pre-designated shift in consciousness.

Whether you can equate this shift in consciousness as inducing an increase in fluid intelligence is dependent on other factors. This is not a singular dynamic core, but rather an integral part of a larger dynamic system that connects the individual not only to their human soul consciousness, but that also of the Genetic Mind.

Within the thalamic complex is a subset known as the Intra-Laminar Nuclei (ILN). ILN neurons venture extensively throughout the cortex, enervating every cortical section. They’re distributed within the central region of each thalamus in a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) mode, enabling widespread influence on the thalamic system. The ILN activation is a significant key to the discovery of the Grand Portal.

The WingMakers’ music, art, and word symbols are designed to stimulate the ILN region to act as a synchronizing mechanism for human consciousness and the Genetic Mind. I realize this is difficult to comprehend, but as research into this brain function ensues over the next twenty years, it will be proven that the ILN is a key “engine” in synchronizing the human-soul consciousness to the fine-grain consciousness of the Genetic Mind, making the Genetic Mind accessible for short bursts at will.

There is within the thalamocortical system what scientists refer to as the reticular thalamic nucleus (nRt). It’s widely accepted by neuroscience that nRt plays a vital role in the judicious regulation of the flow of neural information between the thalamus and cortex. What is not understood is how specific sensory information (light frequencies, sound frequencies, rhythmic synchronization, ULF, symbolic images) can influence how the ILN and nRt systems interoperate to form a hybrid functional cluster that enhances fluid intelligence and accessibility to the Genetic Mind. This discovery is yet twenty years in the making, but it will occur, and the WingMakers will play a critical role in this discovery.


Where DO all our thoughts come from?
Sensory data triggers thoughts. Comparison of actions and thoughts trigger new thoughts. New thoughts trigger new actions. This cycle repeats endlessly in an ascending spiral, lateral spiral, or descending spiral. This is why sensory data quality is so critical.
Just as we have a physical mother and father who seed our physical DNA do we also have a spiritual Mother and Father that seed our spiritual DNA? If not, how are they—the spiritual DNA—created and acquired? If so, what ways are there to contact or connect with this spiritual Mother and Father? “What ways” does not necessarily mean meditative techniques? Do the sensory data streams assist with this?
DNA is no different than any other organic compound in the sense that it is composed of sub-atomic structures that extend out of our three-dimensional range of observation and analysis. The platform or “skeletal” structure for human DNA is composed from the archetype of First Source relative to our superuniverse. I would not refer to this archetype as a spiritual mother or father any more than a blueprint for a house is imbued with such qualities. The WingMakers’ materials produce vibrations (light and sound) that “mingle” at the subatomic levels and are capable of shifting predispositions held within the DNA clusters that govern spiritual will. In this case, the determination to sculpt time into spiritual experience—not simply physical or material experience.

Does the Genetic Mind (GM) use symbology and imagery that exist within the library of All That Is (ATI); and is this imagery echoed within the paintings, imagery and glyphs at least to some extent? I sometimes see glyphs on a gold and silver-white background as in the paintings and I suspect these are related to, or coming from ATI and the GM. Using an analogy, if All That Is is the universal library then the Genetic Mind seems like its most frequent and patronizing customer from the perspective of the Human Instrument; and it uses imagery of a universal nature to communicate to humanity in a language that humanity has given it over the eons. Is this basically correct or a fitting analogy? Could you elucidate on the relationship, connection and communication systems between the Genetic Mind and All That Is and their respective imagery? WMM seems virtually unique in bringing humanity visual imagery from ATI and the GM. Is this a first?

The Genetic Mind is a repository; it is not an active “user” of its own resources. It is more akin to a library and its patrons are the individual human minds that, to varying degrees, have access to its books. The imagery used in the Chamber Paintings is not specifically inspired by, nor taken from, the Genetic Mind. There are common symbols, but this is due to the universality and pre-existent state of geometry.
All That Is [See WingMakers’ glossary.] represents a library on a much grander scale than the Genetic Mind. In principle, the two are similar except for scale. All That Is pertains to the multiverse and the cosmic spirits therein, while the Genetic Mind pertains to the humanoid species within Superuniverse Seven. The imagery of All That Is is codified into a higher dimensional language, which in turn is encoded into the original works within the Tributary Zones. These are then stepped down in frequency to the materials contained on the WingMakers’ website and in the music CDs.

What is unique about the WingMakers’ materials is the subtlety of their encoding and the way in which the materials interleave. It is this interleaving of the materials (imagery, symbols, music, frequencies, poetry, meta-language, philosophy, cosmology, etc.) and the manner in which they activate deeper perceptions of First Source and the Wholeness Navigator that distinguishes these materials from previous dispensations.

All That Is, by its nature, is multi-faceted (wheels within wheels) and in order to distribute this multidimensional complexity, the dispensation must include both sound and light orchestrated into words, music, and pictures. These elements must then be orchestrated to trigger specific resonances within the human genome that lay dormant because—for the most part—present-day culture does not activate or touch these receptors of the human DNA.


Does the genetic mind have structure? If so, what is its shape?

All physical structures are composed of geometric shapes. However, the Genetic Mind is not a physical structure or place. When you move into the higher mind, where the Genetic Mind is situated, geometry is no longer confined to a three-dimensional static paradigm. To explain its non-physical structure is impossible using a three-dimensional language because the Genetic Mind is organic, dynamic, and always changing. In other words, there is no representative “snapshot.”


If there is one painting per chamber, and twenty-three (twenty-four) chambers, where did the extra artwork, etc., come from?

There are seven Tributary Zones of which I am translating from a dimension of time and space that originates—speaking symbolically—from a nonhuman section of the time/space continuum. The Ancient Arrow site is one of these seven “interdimensional” sites, which has been translated into human terms (sensory information that can be received and processed by the thalamocortical system) and distributed in various forms (CD, web, etc.). In the case of the Ancient Arrow site, there are twenty-four chambers because this site is concerned with the genetic architecture of the neuroanatomical human structure.
This site is encoded with information specific to genetics, thus its structure takes on the form of a single helix with the chambers symbolic of the dormant, yet-to-be-activated protein clusters that will shift consciousness to a six-sensory human existence.

In the second section of the book, which will be released next year, the twenty-fourth chamber will be better understood. [The second section of The Ancient Arrow Project has not been released at the time of this writing. No explanation has been given for this delay. Ed.] There is also a philosophy paper that will help clarify the genetic symbolism of the Ancient Arrow site. Furthermore, the twenty-fourth Chamber Painting will be released before the end of July 2001; it is a significant piece of this puzzle.

The remaining six sites are of a different symbolic structure than the Ancient Arrow site, and yet there are certain similarities. All of them have a synthesis of art, music, poetry, language, science, and philosophy because this is the nature of the Tributary Zones. Some sites have a greater emphasis on music than poetry, or art rather than science. It varies depending on the symbolic focus of the Tributary Zone. Collectively the seven Tributary Zones, when strung like pearls, reveal the essential innovations that will be required in order to discover the Grand Portal.

I would recommend that anyone interested in knowing more about the structure of these sites should read the third chapter of the Ancient Arrow book and Chamber four philosophy papers.


Once the seven tributary zones are discovered, mankind will awaken to the Grand Portal. Does this mean that the WingMakers’ material will awaken seven areas of the human spirit/mind, which will lead to mankind’s shift to the fourth dimension in 2012?

At the risk of appearing a bit fastidious, the seven Tributary Zones aren’t discovered so much as they are revealed. This revelation is a gradual dispensation of a new sensory data stream that is encoded with numerous “triggers” that will touch deeply into the next three generations of select humans incarnating upon earth. These sensory data streams will—in effect—crystallize the supernal purpose of the individual and make it accessible to the human mind of the individual. This access may be as innocent as causing the individual to select a career of scientific inquiry into the human genome, or as powerful as awakening the Sovereign Integral state of consciousness.
While the seven Tributary Zones are revealed, the Grand Portal is discovered. Each of the seven disciplines of Lyricus is connected to a Tributary Zone. In other words, one of the Tributary Zones, known as the Ancient Arrow site, is focused on the human genome. The next site that will be revealed is focused on cosmological sciences, and so forth. Each of these areas of emphasis is subtly manifest (encoded) in the sensory data streams of their respective sites, and trigger an awakening in the mind of the recipient.

[The seven disciplines of Lyricus are Genetics, Neo-Sciences (Cosmology), Metaphysics, Sensory Data Streams, Psycho-coherence, Cultural Evolution, Sovereign Integral. Ed.]


Is the WingMakers’ site in Arizona real and has the poetry, music & paintings really come from here? Have any of the other sites been activated? If so, are the recent discoveries at Lake Vostok another WingMakers site? How about Egypt—is the Hall of Records a WingMakers’ site? Is Uluru another site?

I believe the site you’re referring to is the Ancient Arrow site located in northern New Mexico. It is true that there are physical sites on each of the continents (as above, so below).
However, the sites are different than those that I am describing in this story. In part, I’m doing this in honor of these sacred sites, but mostly I’m less interested in depicting the actual physical sites than I am in relaying an accurate portrayal of the seven Tributary Zones.


Are the tributary zones purely spiritual, or do physical events play a part in opening these up?

The seven Tributary Zones exist as places of inquiry and knowledge dissemination. They are the creation of the Central Race and, more specifically, Lyricus. While it is true to say that they exist within the innermost section of each of the seven Superuniverses, they have been exported to each galaxy, somewhat like exporting a library. Thus, each galaxy possesses seven Tributary Zones cast from the archetypal versions existing in the innermost section of the universe that pertains to that particular galaxy. Each Tributary Zone is tuned to the unique characteristics of the humanoid species of a particular Superuniverse, and to some extent, galaxy.
While physical events upon earth and the evolutionary status of humanity impact on the timing of the physical revelation of these seven Tributary Zones, they do not dictate the revelation of these mysterious destinations insofar as the individual is concerned.


How do you translate the Tributary Zones from one dimension to ours? Do you produce all of the material as a translator, or a creator, or both? What does it mean that the WingMakers’ material is encoded? How does this get done?

The seven galactic Tributary Zones exist near the centermost point of the Milky Way galaxy, making them inaccessible to humanity. This is the primary reason that a translator is required. The other reason is that the vibratory rate of the Tributary Zones is purposely accelerated in order to ensure that only those entities of a compatible vibration may enter. There are members of the humanoid species, throughout the galaxy, that attend these sites in their dream state or meditation sessions.
It is impossible to translate these sites from their original dimension to earth, or any other three-dimensional planet, without changing the content. This is because the vibratory rate of the original materials must be decelerated, and in this deceleration process, change occurs. Technically, the process is less akin to translation from one language to another, and more similar to transposing from a higher key, or vibratory rate, to a lower. You can think of these seven sites as knowledge repositories, in multiple mediums (sound, light, knowledge, language, mathematics, etc.) focused on each of the seven disciplines of Lyricus. These seven disciplines are expressed differently, but each contains multiple mediums that heighten and emphasize how integrated knowledge is a spectrum that includes art, metaphysics, and science, and that unified properly, this spectrum is the key to unveiling the Grand Portal.

The equivalent of the Ancient Arrow site, within the galactic core, contains three-dimensional art forms that are always in a state of movement. They respond to sound wave pressure, as well as the thoughts of those who are present at the site. There is no method to presently replicate this on earth. Thus, the paintings must be fixed in time and space. I decide this fixed state, so, in this case, I am a “creator.” However, I have extensive experience in making these interpretations based on research of color vibrations, human perceptual systems, sophistication of the visual cortex, associative values of form, and methods of catalyzing new receptive fields.

In many respects, the sound requires a comparable process. The major themes are transposed to audible frequencies, but the instrumentation cannot be replicated. The sound generation of the galactic Tributary Zones is not from instruments, but rather particles set in motion by thought forms. Even in this oblique description, I have only hinted at the real process. It would take too long to describe. The important element to know is that I am allowed artistic autonomy to transpose the themes into new structures using human instrumentation, human compositional techniques, and human vocals. These elements provide an anchoring point to the music, making them more accessible to the human ear. From these descriptions, I think you have a glimmer of understanding for the process I use.

As for the encoding and how this is accomplished, I can only tell you that there is subtle information encoded within the WingMakers’ materials that operate as a navigational system, leading deeper into the purpose of each site or Tributary Zone. This is part of a selection process, and relates exclusively to the Wholeness Navigator consciousness. More on this aspect I cannot disclose.

There is another form of encoding, which is not esoteric, and this element relates to the interaction of the human instrument to the materials. The music, art, glyphs, and texts are encoded with mathematical and metaphysical embellishments that are accessible through interaction techniques, some of which have been disclosed in the fourth philosophy paper. Through these interactions, the human instrument decodes the information that helps it transition to the exploratory energy system where deeper insights can be achieved.

Could you please describe in more detail what the Tributary Zones are and what their purpose is?

The Galactic Tributary Zones are the knowledge repositories of Lyricus. They house the local Lyricus staff, research centers, teaching facilities, and various tools that we believe—in this particular case—will help humanity focus its technology and efforts in the pursuit of the Grand Portal. As I have reported previously, there are seven Tributary Zones within the galactic core. These Tributary Zones relate to the seven primary disciplines that comprise the Lyricus “library of catalytic tools.”
[The following answer by James contains the acronym “SECU.” For the sake of clarity I have brought James’ definition of a SECU forward. The definition appears later in this document under, Extraterrestrials. Ed.]“What you call humans, we call Sovereign Entities of the Central Universe (SECU—pronounced SeeQue). SECUs are the alpha and omega. They are not time-bound nor restrained by the adornments of bodies. They are the primal form finished and honed to the perfection of their creator, and in this, we are all the same.”

Lyricus is able to track and monitor SECUs (Sovereign Integral [sic.] of the Central Universe) [Sovereign Entity. Ed.] no matter what physical structures they inhabit. When we judge that a particular SECU is properly prepared, they (their Wholeness Navigator) are transported to one of our training centers, which is unlike any you can conceive of on earth. I use the words “Training Center” only because I can think of nothing else to describe them. Candidates are not necessarily spiritually minded, nor are they exemplars of humanity in terms of their personality, physical body, or temperament. They are, however, advanced SECUs operating in human form, typically unconscious of their mission and purpose.

These fortunate entities are escorted from their human instrument and guided to the Tributary Zone that is best suited for their purpose and mission. They are generally taught in the form of a dialogue—not unlike the Lyricus discourses depict. They are allowed to query masters, and the masters are allowed to elucidate on relevant topics.

It will come as no surprise that Einstein was one such SECU that was attended by Lyricus masters. He was allowed to formulate “his” theories through a dialogue with a single master. When he returned to his human instrument the experience and knowledge was lodged in his higher mind and a trigger was then required to draw it into consciousness.

These triggers are carefully orchestrated event strings that the master in charge of the SECU coordinates through a process we call—again, I’m translating as best I can—lucid re-orientation. This process requires that the information gained while at the Tributary Zone filters into the consciousness in a re-collectible state. In order for this to occur, Dr. Einstein would experience an event or EDSS (Encoded Data Sensory Stream) that induces, or triggers a recollection of a seed memory. The seed memory is the most critical part of the lucid re-orientation process because it alone carries sufficient power to draw the new knowledge into the conscious state of the human mind. I have grossly simplified this process, and words are very vexing limitations to describe this. I had better stop here before I completely confuse you.

The reason that the physically translated Tributary Zones are critical to earth-bound SECUs is that they are the most certain catalysts of the seed memory. It is very hard to transpose super-conscious knowledge and decelerate it for conscious recall by a human instrument. And this will be required in much higher frequency over the next one hundred years, so the Tributary Zones are being raised to a new level—an EDSS—that will trigger seed memories.


If the WingMakers story is both truth and fiction, how are we to discern which is which? If the identity of the WingMakers is quite authentic (i.e. true), how can it also be myth (i.e. fiction)?

Buddha stated: “All reality is a myth. Myth becomes ever nearer to reality.” The quality of one’s discernment is proportional to their ability to accelerate their movement to the Sovereign Integral state of consciousness. A system of philosophy like the WingMakers requires a high-level of discernment, and it is therefore teaching on multiple levels simultaneously by intermixing truth and fiction.
This material is not meant for the weak of mind or lazy of heart. It is extremely challenging on many different levels, discernment being one of them. There is a significant amount of information encoded into the art and music that bypasses the conscious mind. In this way, discernment is not required. However, The Ancient Arrow Project story is indeed fiction based on acquired insight of factual scenarios.


Interview three with Dr. Neruda mentions technologies from real U.S. and Russian corporations. The technologies originate from ACIO research. I have checked this out, and the info on the Mig-29 and the Internet compression technologies stand up to scrutiny. Is there a risk of legal action against yourself, Mark and the South Bay Group for making these allegations?

Yes, but it is an acceptable risk.

Why has the storyline changed from Dr. Anderson to Dr. Neruda and why the time changes in the story line?

The story was modified to track misappropriations of the Ancient Arrow story within the marketplace. There are more subtle changes than the ones you mentioned in your question. None of the primary (encoded) content has been altered since it was first published.

Why did the WingMakers allow the ACIO to discover the AA site, if the ACIO was going to keep the public out?

The ACIO was the only earth-based organization that could decode the content. Because Dr. Neruda worked at the ACIO and was known to be the key architect of the discovery’s public release, it was essential that the discovery occur at the ACIO.

Why did the WingMakers not use their time travel abilities to insure that the planting of the map artifact did not result in loss of the students’ lives, therefore effectively nullifying any chance of this event having a ‘dark cloud’ over its happening, and subsequent WingMakers’ information. Would you consider changing the story line and erasing the needless deaths of the students who found the artifact?

Every discovery of import has a “dark cloud” over it. It is intrinsic to the drama of life that important discoveries are dimensional and esoteric—that is, they include the exoteric and esoteric life rules, which number among them the sacrifice of human life. The students represent the metaphor of the innocent discoverers that must be sacrificed in order to underscore the importance of their discovery.

Did the WingMakers leave material at all the Seven Tributary sites at the same time to be found in sequence? Or did they leave it over a period of time?

The WingMakers’ sites—each of the seven—will be translated in a specific order. Remember that each site carries a central theme that is connected to the seven disciplines of Lyricus. These seven disciplines—collectively—are the triggers for those incarnating in approximately thirty-five to forty years who will be the scientists, scholars, psychologists, and artists that will uncover and disseminate the Grand Portal.


In answer to a previous question, you said that the Ancient Arrow story was factual because there were ‘techniques that could be applied to secure the information. Do you mean remote viewing, and its associated Re-Play technology?

The information is based on factual data secured through a form of remote viewing, referred to by my teaching organization as sensory bi-location. SBL is different from classic RV because it is associated with the higher mind rather than the psychic channels of astral vision. Because of this distinction, SBL permits one to analyze motive and intent, in addition to the sensory/action environment that RV technology acknowledges. SBL is also more focused on active sensory channel selection, rather than reactive selection as in the case of RV.

Of the physical WingMakers’ materials (poems, music, philosophy, art, etc.) what is the most potent catalyst for our consciousness? Is this also the case with the etheric versions or the originals that reside in the Galactic Tributary Zones?

This is dependent on the individual and how they respond to different vibrations as well as their innate learning preference of eye-brain versus ear-brain. However, independent of this assessment, the ear-brain is more powerful as a catalyst for consciousness and transformation than is the eye-brain. The reason is that the harmonics and overtones of music can embody significantly more encoded information than that of a painting or word symbol.
This is also true when contrasted with the primal Light and Sound of First Source. The Sound vibrations are considered more deeply connective and catalytic to the consciousness than the cosmic Light if for no other reason than that they are easier to absorb and assimilate than the structure of Light, which is often too intense to absorb and integrate.


I am interested in the paintings and especially the symbols in them. Can these be translated into English? Are they the Senzar symbols, which DK mentions in his writings?

Senzar, besides being an alphabet of its own, can be rendered in cipher characters, which correspond to the nature of ideographs rather than of syllables. Senzar, as a language, was brought by the Central Race to earth. The reason is quite simple. Ideographic language can convey a tremendously complex concept in a single character. It’s very efficient and can be effectively encoded for highly targeted transmission. Cosmological and mathematical concepts of significant importance could be reduced to a symbolic rendering, but the contextual meaning of color and secondary matrix brought the full meaning of the symbol to light, thus its encoding was complete.
In other words, you can look at a specific symbol of the twenty-fourth Chamber Painting (e.g., the second, primary character in the vertical matrix in the upper left section of the painting).

If taken out of its framework, this particular character means one thing, which would transpose to Sanskrit, but when viewed in its contextual matrix, it is elevated to Senzar, where its meaning is encoded as representing the Wholeness Navigator within the human instrument.

Senzar is a language that flows between alphabetic characters, mathematical symbols, and musical notes. It is an integrated language, sometimes referred to as the Universal Language of Light or the Insignias of First Source.


Al Bielek said the paintings we see and buy are not the real ones, “…the real ones are classified.” Is this so? Are there parts of the paintings that have been changed, or are they all 100 percent authentic as transposed from Lyricus?

The Chamber Paintings, as they’re represented on the WingMakers’ website, are translations of the real paintings. The original works reside within the Tributary Zone near the galactic center of the Milky Way galaxy. The original “paintings” are photonically animated by an advanced technology that permits the art to morph intelligently as dictated by the music. In other words, music is the engine that animates the painting. The original environment in which the art is stored requires that I, the translator, take a “snapshot” of the painting that best represents the dynamic image statically.
These original works are not “classified” by any government organization I assure you. They simply exist in a different dimension and are visible to a different range of senses. The DVD “Meditations in Timespace” is an attempt to capture some sense of how the paintings are actually presented in their native environment.


“Octavio Fifteen” is 85 65 which corresponds to “The Earth Kumara.” You warned me about esoteric numerology earlier, but the Corteum does relate to Sirius and according to DK, Sanat Kumara (with a value of 120) does have a special relationship to the Sirian Logos. Something is going on here. Either this means something significant to your story’s esoteric meaning or it is a mere coincidence of language structure combined with my overactive imagination. Can you tell me which it is? The thing that bothers me about this correspondence is that (at least up to chapter eight) Fifteen appears to be a pretty ruthless character.

[In the framework of DK’s teachings (Hindu religion and Theosophy), Sanat Kumara is an advanced cosmic Entity, who for all intents and purposes, is the God of our planet. He ensouls this world in which we live. I will leave it to the reader to research this topic further, for there are various views available. Ed.]
You are correct that the works developed by the Lyricus order are encoded (as we’ve discussed before); however, they’re not necessarily encoded in the numerological equivalents that you apply. We do not presume that this equates as effective instruction for the aspiring student. It is more the case that we are in the habit of encoding information for the purposes of discretion. When the habit is so well formed and the work is so important, as is the case with the Tributary Zones, we naturally encode information in numerological, symbolic, language undertones, mantristic rhythms, color frequencies, and musical frequencies. All of these aspects are woven into a deeper meaning that reflects the cosmological and multiverse structures that bind human consciousness to the Wholeness Navigator.

Do the dates August 12, 2003, August 12, 1983, August 12, 1963, August 12, 1943, August 12, 1923, ad infinitum, have any significance as far as time travel and earth biorhythms are concerned? These dates are mentioned in the Montauk Project series of books as being significant dates for time travel e.g. the Philadelphia Experiment.

No. BST does not require a fix on earthly or human biorhythms. BST, or even lower forms of time travel, is not a function-relationship of portals, gateways, or dimensional alignments. It is a function of technology appropriately married—in this case—to a human operator.


How many chambers does the Hakomi site have? Does the Hakomi site have chamber paintings? And if so, when can we see them?

The Hakomi site consists of seventeen chambers. [Note that there are twenty-one Hakomi music tracks at the WingMakers’ website. Ed.] Music is the one consistency across all of the seven sites. Art is also used in all the sites, but it is slightly different in its use of symbols and even style. As to when you can see them, you may already be seeing them as Mark has posted some of the Hakomi art on the WingMakers site, though I can’t say for certain where it is in terms of the page URL. Others will follow with the release of subsequent music CDs.


Who/what are you James? Where do you get your information?

In my dominant reality, I am known as Mahu Nahi. I am a member of a teaching organization whose roots are very ancient, but paradoxically, very connected with humanity’s future. This teaching organization is concerned with transporting a sensory data stream to earth in order to catalyze select individuals of the next three generations to bring innovations to the fields of science, art, and philosophy. These innovations will enable the discovery and establishment of the Grand Portal on earth.
I can be likened to a translator who “transports” already existing Tributary Zones to earth in the form of a comprehensible sensory data stream. This data stream will have both explicit and implicit content that incarnating souls will be tuned to recognize. This material will awaken them to the blueprints of discovery that were encoded into their DNA at conception.

My information—as it pertains to the WingMakers’ material—derives from the seven Tributary Zones that were created by this very same teaching organization. I was involved in the design of these Tributary Zones, and consequently commissioned to translate them into data streams appropriate for the human neuroanatomical system, which required my incarnation into a human body.


You are known as Mahu Nahi. Is Mahu Nahi another incarnation of your spirit that has commissioned James (your current incarnation) to translate this material for the people of earth?
No. My name within Lyricus is Mahu Nahi. This is how I am known among my students and associates. In effect, Mahu Nahi is the name of my SECU personality, while James is the name of my human personality of this time.

Are you a ‘Master’ as some proclaim?

There are so many definitions of the term “master” that I am not willing to say I am this, or I am not this, unless a definition accompanies the word. Since you did not provide a definition with your question, I cannot provide an answer. I will, however, acknowledge the spirit of your question, which is: what am I?

In this regard, I am as you are. I am a multidimensional being who lives simultaneously in a spectrum of realities. My dominant reality enables me to perceive behind and beyond the three-dimensional “surface” of this reality. Quite possibly the same as you or other readers.

In my case, as a result of this ability, I am able to translate art, music, poetry, and philosophy that are from my dominant reality into yours. In so doing, I have translated sensory data that have th einnate potential to catalyze future discoveries that will help redefine the human soul.

Now, does this mean I am a master? The output of personal behavior is always compared to the goal of your internal expectation and the output of your fellow man. This is typically how we are measured, are we not? There is no measure or comparison for the individualized purpose of one who is operating in accord to his or her purpose.

“Masters” abound in the human arena. Some are excellent teachers, but very, very few teach how to transition from the human-mind dominant reality to that of the human-soul. Even fewer teach how to transition to the awareness and functionality of the Sovereign Integral state. One thing I can tell you, trust no one’s proclamation (including mine), instead, examine in-depth the fruits of the supposed master and determine how they empower you to become your own self-sufficient teacher. If you can find this, then you have found a master worthy of your time and energy.

I am going to be specific with my wording here. I am aware that you are a multidimensional entity that exists simultaneously in eternity, within the physical body, throughout incarnations in time. This question is specific to the physical entity answering this question in the here and now. Are you a standard human being, genetically identical to all categories of human on the earth in this time period, born physically from a human woman? Alternatively, are you a clone, hybrid, alien, etc. placed on earth by “others”?

I was born as a human with very human parents. If you examined my DNA at birth you would find very little difference from your own. The element of distinction is that my consciousness was free of the survival-based energy system that conditions humans to a very nominal realization of their inherent purpose. Within my consciousness was a connection to my purpose and lineage that outshone the indoctrination process that virtually all humans are subject to. It was this identification to my purpose that caused me, at an early age, to recollect my purpose in incarnating as a human being.

Why the secrecy regarding your whereabouts and identity? I know that you want the material to take precedence over a possible “messiah” figure. Are you concerned about the CIA, FBI, NSA, MJ12, MI6, Illuminati, Bilderberg’s whoever etc. tracking you down?

There are several groups who are presently aware of my existence on earth. For the most part, my work will only appear to them as adding to the misinformation programs that they’ve already erected. To most secret organizations, the more that is written about them that is divergent from previously held notions, the better. It is this very divergence that creates and perpetuates the uncertainty and stirs the murkiness in which they remain suitably concealed from the public’s eye.
This was purposeful on my part because it would be relatively easy for certain groups to find me, and if they chose, compromise my mission. Thus, I have shared many truths about these organizations, knowing that these very truths are divergent from the established speculation and, ironically as it may seem, by this divergence, I am protected because WingMakers is perceived as a mythology and does not disclose hard evidence.

Because of my alliances, it is unlikely that anyone would choose to knowingly hinder this mission because these groups have a high regard for my lineage, which in some respects, is the only thing that restrains them. There is very little known about Lyricus. It is truly the most enigmatic teaching organization within the broader universe. Its capabilities are unknown, but it is rightly assumed to be respectful of this organization.

As for my personal anonymity, this is a choice I made in order to curtail my teaching mode to individuals of this time in favor of directing my life’s work to a select population of incarnating SECUs. This requires me to focus on transposing the sensory data streams of the Tributary Zones to a digital media platform for future generations.


Why did you think it necessary to make yourself known as the creator of the WM materials, rather than leave the materials first presented as being a creation of humans from the future, called “WingMakers”?

I have always been consistent on this issue. I am not the creator of the WingMakers’ materials; I am the translator. The materials existed before I incarnated on earth. I have taken the original content and transduced it (for lack of a better term) into a form (music, art, words, symbols) that would resonate to the human senses and mind. The original materials, of which only a small fraction has been translated and published on the Internet, are created by a subset of the WingMakers called Lyricus (my term). Lyricus teachers assembled the materials and have exported them to the various life-bearing planets like Earth. At the appropriate time, a lineage of teachers incarnate and begin the rigorous process of translating the materials into “human form.” I am merely the first of this lineage to begin the process of translation. As to your question, the lineage of teachers I speak of do—in a real sense—represent humanity’s future.

Do you think that something akin to “The WingMakers” inspired you to create this myth, or are you just lonely and a little bored?

I was not inspired to create the WingMakers’ mythology; I was commissioned to perform this specific task. No one requires inspiration to carry out a task required of them by the very nature of their purpose as a life form. Further, I did not create a myth; I translated a Tributary Zone into a sensory data stream that can catalyze the human thalamocortical system to awaken its innate connection to the Genetic Mind. I refer to it as a mythology only because I must convey—in good conscience—that the material is not completely factual. Also, myths enable a suspension of disbelief in the reader, an opening that is required for the spark of imagination, on the part of the reader/viewer, to feel the meaning.


Each individual must know them self to be free of all forms of external reliance. This is not to imply that one should not trust others or band together in alliances of friendship and community. It is simply a warning that relative truth is constantly shifting in the hands of those who desire to control, and even though their motives may be of good will, it is still a form of control. When the hierarchy withholds information, the interpretive centers for relative truth are positioned to acquire and maintain power rather than dispensing the empowerment of Source equality.” Reading the above paragraph if we replace “hierarchy” with “James”, don’t you think that you’re actually performing a form of control (even though you may be good-willed) by withholding information instead of dispensing the empowerment of Source equality right now? Also, from time to time we see the material take a “turn” which can easily be equated to the teaching’s reference to hierarchy: “relative truth is constantly shifting in the hands of those who desire control.” Have you also considered the effects of slowly feeding information in terms of a built-up interdependence between the WM audience and yourself?

[Note that this is the one instance in which the term “hierarchy” is being used according to the meaning ascribed to it by the Lyricus and WingMakers material. It is NOT being used in the Theosophical sense as described in the Preface. The extract being referenced by the questioner is from the Chamber Two philosophy “The Shifting Models of Existence. P. 1” Ed.]
As a member of Lyricus, I am focused on translating Lyricus content to human standards—both in terms of material and technology. This requires a significant effort and time. If I had the time to explain the translation process, I think you would understand. The material is encoded and this is the primary distinction. Translating this content is dissimilar in every way to translating Spanish into English. So time is an issue. More to your point, the materials are released not according to my timetable, but according to the mesh of incarnating souls, the collective signature vibration of the species, and the timetable of the Grand Portal’s discovery. The desire to have all the material available to peruse won’t be fulfilled for thirty to forty years. This is not a result of control or manipulation, but is in response to a plan that is well engineered and proven to be effective.


I have noticed in some responses to questioning news-list participants you seem to be very time limited but will answer the questions in-between other pressing engagements and I wondered what these other pressing engagements might be?

My work requires that I interact with others, as this mission is much larger than one person. Sometimes this means that I travel, sometimes it requires that I host travelers. Also, the translation process is very time consuming owing to the intricacy and complexity of the original material. It is not like channeling where I open my mouth and the words drop out. Especially in the case of the music and art, it requires a tremendous amount of time to orchestrate the translations and try and keep them true to their original form while converting them to three-dimensional art forms. In the case of the music, it requires that I locate and work with the right kind of talents, as this is a more collaborative translation when compared to the other material.


I was wondering if you participate in the WingMakers’ forum in anyway? If not why do you not participate in it? Do you perhaps distance yourself from this news-list so as not to become a savior for those who might be looking for one?

I do not participate in any forum or earth-bound organization—including WingMakers LLC. [This was a previous forum that was discontinued. Ed.] I am here to translate and make available the higher circuits of experiential learning, to help catalyze the discovery of the Grand Portal. The only organization that I can say I am affiliated with is Lyricus. I am not present on earth to validate anyone’s belief system or pronounce him or her an initiate of the “True Way.” I prefer to focus on my mission, knowing that modern life has its methods of distraction.

Do you have other outlets for your teachings that you might spend more time with rather than the forum?

I want to remind you that these are not “my teachings.” I am not teaching anything. I am translating materials that go underneath the human “radar” of censorship and egotistic control and strike resonance with that part of you that is termed the Wholeness Navigator.

You have Sarah de Rosnay and at least one other helper (lady in the photo). How have these people become disciples/students/helpers to you? Do you intend to take on more followers in the future?

Sarah and Mark are the only ones who directly assist me in the operations of my work. I have a group of students that I work with on many dimensions of consciousness, and I work with these students through the Tributary Zones known to you as the WingMakers’ materials.
Yes, I will take on new students using the WingMakers’ material as the medium of my teaching. I intend to remain unknown as a human personality, allowing the sensory data streams of the Tributary Zones to perform the majority of my teaching.

[The photo of the lady can be found through one of the various hidden links contained on the First Source CD-ROM, which can be ordered at the WingMakers’ website. Ed.]


You have a studio in New York. How do you finance yourself, as all of your time is taken up with WingMakers translation work? I am assuming you have a hidden life in paid employment?

I live a very simple life, and support myself through means that I will not disclose.

How did the WingMakers reveal themselves to you and place a profound calling upon your life?

I am a member of a teaching order that has existed before the creation of the planet Earth. I realize this may seem like an impossible reality, but it is my reality nonetheless. This teaching order is allied with the esoteric teaching orders of earth. The teaching order which I represent is not known in your world because it has chosen to remain hidden until the Grand Portal discovery process is made public.
You may refer to my teaching order as Lyricus. It is the closest name that resembles the vibration of its true name in your native language. Lyricus is aligned with the Central Race, or WingMakers, and the great majority of its members are from the Central Race.

Within Lyricus, expertise is centered on seven disciplines. These include the fields of genetics, cosmological sciences, metaphysics, sensory data streams, psycho-coherence, and cultural evolution. [Sovereign Integral is the seventh. Ed.] We are not, as you can see, focused exclusively on philosophy or spiritual teachings. Our central purpose is the irrefutable discovery of the humanoid soul upon three-dimensional, life-bearing planets.

Lyricus could be likened to the Jesuits or Tibetan monks of the Central Race, except that they place a much more significant emphasis on the nexus of the integrated sciences and arts. Nonetheless, they are a faction of the Central Race and bear responsibility for shepherding the humanoid populations within the universe to the Grand Portal, and thereby indoctrinating the species, as a whole, into the broader network of the intelligent, interconnected universe.

This task requires a very broad agenda, encompassing genetics at its core, and the other six disciplines mentioned above as integral, but peripheral forces that propel a humanoid species to discover its own animating life force—the Wholeness Navigator. Lyricus employs a variety of sensory data streams to awaken a species, ranging from music, books, art, science, culture, and mythology. Generally, these are isolated expressions, but as the species draws closer to the Grand Portal, the sensory data streams are increasingly integrated, encoded, and represent potent forces for expansion of consciousness.

Upon earth there is an order of non-physical teachers with whom we coordinate our agenda and essential objectives. [The Hierarchy of Theosophy. Ed.] These teachers are experienced in the human condition, and thus possess the critical elements of compassion and empathy of which we—of Lyricus—are sometimes less replete. They provide stewardship of our objectives in the context of the human condition and advise us in the matters of the emotional and mental conflicts that confound and confuse humanity.

Now, back to your question. I am a teacher of encoded sensory data streams and was trained, at my request, to embody as the human translator of the galactic Tributary Zones, making them intelligible to the human race of the twenty-first century. The WingMakers did not reveal themselves to me any more than fellow human beings “reveal” themselves to you.

Perhaps one of the greatest secrets in the universe—as it pertains to organizations—is the Lyricus Teaching Order. It is a bedrock SOA that is invisible and likes to remain so until the Grand Portal is discovered.

If its identity were disclosed sooner, it would fall under swift and persistent attack by every quarter of power. (Within Lyricus, we refer to the Quarters of Power as consisting of government, science, religion, and culture.) We know this from experience. Thus, we work through existing structures and place our influence within every quarter. I am not, by any means, the only one representing Lyricus who is embodied at this time on earth. While I may be the nucleus of the cultural power quarter, I have counterparts in each of the other three quarters who are equally absent of notoriety and visible presence, but nonetheless are quietly going about developing their missions to promote the changes required to discover the Grand Portal.

Even as we introduce ourselves to earth, it is done under the guise of mythology and story. We do not assert ourselves in the context of fact because we would then certainly be feared by the alignment of power within each quarter. In this fear lies the natural tension of a species as it nears the Grand Portal. The quarters of power will resist if they know the goal is to establish the Grand Portal as a node on the Sovereign Integral Network [see glossary. Ed.]. This resistance would make impossible the necessary funding and lawmaking to achieve this breakthrough discovery. Thus, Lyricus sends catalysts to each quarter for the purpose of establishing a “null zone” that can act as an incubator and catalyst of these required changes.

Lyricus is an unimaginably large SOA [Source Organizational Alignment] with substantial influence and authority. Its “director” is the seventh Archetype of First Source. You can think of Lyricus as the preservationists of truth, and the only “truth” we seek to preserve is the accessibility granted a humanoid species to discover—through its own initiative—the Grand Portal. We work at the level of a species, not an individual, although we do work with individuals as a means to test our knowledge of the species. Earth-based organizations in the religious quarter are more inclined to work with individuals, so it is understandable that when someone hears about Lyricus or the WingMakers, they would naturally assert that DK [see Djwhal Khul. Ed.] didn’t disclose our existence, which is odd, especially if we were aligned in our objectives.

If, “Lyricus is aligned with the Central Race, or WingMakers, and the great majority of its members are from the Central Race,” does that emanate from within this solar system, and if so what scheme and globe? If outside the system, are we talking in the region of the Pleiades? (The teachings do have a strong Ray Three, third aspect about them.) If this is so, then does the ‘Central Race’ have any relationship to the Central Spiritual Sun?

[This particular questioner is seeking a correspondence between the third ray of Active Intelligence which relates to the “region of the Pleiades” (according to the esoteric cosmology of the Alice A. Bailey books), and Lyricus. Note: there are many websites available with information about the seven rays. Ed.]
Lyricus is foremost a teaching brotherhood organized around seven knowledge categories—each a component of the process that enables a species to position their apex technology and knowledge in pursuit of the irrefutable scientific discovery of the human soul (known as the Grand Portal). This discovery, unlike the more personal, introspective process of the individual, is engineered for a species at large, and therefore, implies a much more significant effort and coordination.

It is in service to this goal, that the Central Spiritual Sun is indeed aligned and serves as an amplification system to the goals of Lyricus. The primary relationship between Lyricus and the Central Spiritual Sun is comparable to a sailboat and its relationship to the wind. Since Lyricus is an outbound mission, the Central Sun acts as an energizing force in the distribution of the teachings of Lyricus—not so much as a creator of content and principle, but rather as a readiness or preparatory factor in the target species for the Lyricus teachings.

While Lyricus is aligned intellectually to the Hierarchy and its goals and objectives, it also carries a separate teaching through encoded sound and light, of which WingMakers is a part.

[In his answer, James is using the term “Hierarchy” according to the Theosophical model, as explained in the Preface. James is using the vocabulary most familiar to the questioner. In this context, Hierarchy is earth’s SOA. See the section, Source Organizational Alignment (SOA). Ed.]


Did the WingMakers have dealings with any others in our neck of the woods, galaxy, etc.? Is that why there are other teachings, like the Urantia Book, and other channeled materials that are very similar to WM Philosophy?

The exportation of the teachings called WingMakers is in fact the work assembled by Lyricus. The name WingMakers is simply an encoded word that has been used to represent a portion of these teachings for humanity. In terms of Lyricus’ mandate and reach, it is as far-reaching as any organization within the universe, and it is certainly an influence in other life-bearing planets within the Milky Way galaxy. Other teachings like Urantia or channeled teaching stem from different sources. In some cases there is similarity and to the degree this occurs, it is because the universe is not entirely subjective.

Did they (the WingMakers) actually incarnate here to leave the artifacts or did they just manifest it and leave?

Representatives from Lyricus incarnate among humanity instead of physically traveling to life-bearing planets in spaceships or other types of vehicles. This is done for efficiencies, stealth, and deepening the understanding of how to integrate the Lyricus teachings into the indigenous culture. These personalities are mostly invisible among the human population. As they near their eleventh birthday they typically become activated by another Lyricus member who has come before them that triggers their consciousness. These catalysts from Lyricus may be physically present or spiritually connected at the dream subconscious levels. Whatever the case, this activation is what “downloads” the mission objectives and triggers the sense of inviolate duty that accompanies these embedded workers of Lyricus.

When I first read Vision of Mantustia I thought that this Being might be Sanat Kumara. Is Mantustia Sanat Kumara and, if not, who is Mantustia?

Mantustia is an ascended master who is a remarkable entity of planetary significance to earth; however, it is not Sanat Kumara. Within the Lyricus Teaching Order there are distinctions between personalities based on the teaching method employed by the personality.
There is a wide range of methodologies that can be employed, and there are certain teachers who have found methods to synthesize these methods in such a way that they can cause revelatory experience in their students through a simple exchange of language. Mantustia has developed many of the most famous discourses of Lyricus. He is a master’s master of the most esoteric order within Lyricus that develops discourses, instructional methodologies, and experiential learning environments within the human genome. You will be able to recognize his voice as it is has an uncanny ability to integrate paradox with truth in an authoritative undertone. If heard in its pure, native language, Mantustia’s voice and wisdom borders on the incomparable.

Are the WingMakers similar to the Manasaputras or the Greater Builders as referred to in some literature?

[The name “Manasaputras” is Sanskrit and generally means “Sons of Mind.” These are an advanced order of cosmic lives who are the builders of worlds. Ed.]
The Form Builders (as I refer to them) are not the WingMakers. Think of the WingMakers as a collective identity, similar to the term we would use for “humanity”, except that the WingMakers represent the seventh universe central race. They are the “child” of the seventh Archetype of First Source, while humanity is the “child” of the WingMakers.

Within the WingMakers, just as within humanity, there is tremendous diversity. In other words, not everyone who is a member of the seventh universe central race is concerned with the spiritual welfare of humanity. Thus, a teaching resource was developed in very, very ancient times (as humanity thinks of these things), called Lyricus (its real name cannot be disclosed in the spoken languages of earth).

Lyricus, in itself, is a mythical wisp of smoke in the arcane/occult/mystery schools of earth. I am not permitted to disclose much about this organization, so it forces me to “dance” around questions a bit. The Form Builders are emissaries of Lyricus, but they are decidedly different from WingMakers in that their function for existence is to be exported to developing, life-bearing planets, and act as the genetic forbearers of humanoid life forms.

Within Lyricus are seven primary disciplines of knowledge. The centermost and unifying discipline is genetics. The Form Builders are part of this discipline, but they are more concerned with the species at its formative stages of development, and less so when it nears its apex opportunities for discovering the Grand Portal. The Form Builders are creations of Lyricus.

You’ve heard the expression “cycles within cycles” or wheels within wheels. Here it is expressed in the fact that each life-bearing galaxy has a humanoid archetype just as each of the seven universes has one, and within each sector of a galaxy (usually divided into approximately one thousand sectors) there resides a sub-archetype based on the galactic model. This sub-archetype is what is referred to in the arcane school as the Form Builders.

It is one of the beautiful ironies of First Source that Form Builders, for all their mysterious and cloaked identity, are actually present in every living human in the form of their body, mind, and spirit integration. The Form Builders are part of a very extensive organization within Lyricus that you can think of as a vast scientific body of geneticists, but not of the kind of earth. Form Builders do not study genetics, they create them; and they do not reveal their creations, they are their creations.

The strongest bridge between the AAB materials and the WMM is the Lyricus Teaching Order, but it will take some time before the teachings of Lyricus are brought to earth. Nonetheless, when these teachings are released, they will support the weight of many, many students as they migrate from the old worldview of spirituality to the new.

[The following diagram is taken directly from James’ answer to this question concerning the Manasaputras or what James calls, “Form Builders.”]


Is it fair to state that you are part of a Lyricus Teaching Order that is based in the Sirian system despite the fact that you hail from a distant galaxy?

This is a difficult question to answer, at least with words. It requires that you reorganize your definition of an entity. Your question implies that I cannot operate in multiple systems simultaneously. I know you are aware that there are those within the Brotherhood [earth’s Hierarchy of teachers. Ed.] who practice bi-location. While this is typically considered in the context of a physical body, multi-location in the higher bodies is not only possible, but also necessary for members of Lyricus. Time will not permit me to list the reasons for this, though the most important reason is quite intuitive: multi-location enables us to “spread” the presence of our vibratory knowledge to a wider audience.

What process is undertaken to decide upon a public release date for each piece of material? For example, do you have a list that says e.g., 20th of February, 2008 philosophy twenty-three is released?

The assessment is based on factors I cannot—at this time—disclose. There is a general schedule for release, but it is not specified to the day or even week and month. It is triggered, in part, by external events.

By what means are “they” keeping track of our progress in assimilating the material? Where are they now?

There is no one who “tracks” an individual’s progress in assimilating the teachings of Lyricus. Everyone emits or broadcasts a signature vibration. This vibration is collectively woven into a species. It is this vibration that is “read” by Lyricus and it is understood in general terms what the progress of the species is, based on this collective signature.

What changes can we expect to feel before we are ready for more categories to be revealed?

I’m not sure what you meant by “categories.” I will assume you mean the seven disciplines of Lyricus. The signature vibration of the species determines the timing of this dispensation—exoterically speaking.

常见问题
主权整体是扩张的透明存在，独特地适合我们已经开始进入的时代。- 詹姆斯
自推出以来，WingMakers的网站引起了各种反应，也许没有人像对其创造者的谜一样坚持不懈，以及为什么我寻求匿名。我邀请你研究这个网站所包含的材料，不要太在意谁创造了这些材料以及为什么，而是更关注如何在你的个人生活中应用这些材料，只要它们与你最深处的自我产生共鸣。

如果你读了我对WingMakers讨论论坛成员和各种学生提出的问题的答复，你会深入了解我的目的，如果你仔细阅读，你会明白为什么这些材料以它们的方式存在。在这个简短的介绍中，我将尝试对这些材料和它们的目的提供更多的洞察力。

在上个世纪，当代信仰体系正确地将重点放在了爱上，更具体地说，爱是神圣的、无条件的、所有人自由分享的，无论他们在社会秩序中处于什么位置。人类最伟大的导师也曾宣称过这种情感，但爱仍然是人类最被误解的概念之一。

爱是一种基本行动，其本身并不足以使一个物种与第一源头或上帝的目的和目标相一致。虽然爱在凝聚人类和治愈其自我造成的创伤方面起着至关重要的作用，但正是对新科学的了解和正确应用，将向人类的心灵揭示人类的灵魂。而正是这种揭示将使人类--作为一个集体物种--有意识地与第一源泉的目的保持一致。

造翼者不时地化身为人类，以便将其教义直接带给人类。在人类历史上，造翼者有许多不同的名字，但他们总是参与将精神文化和科学带到人类发展的头脑中。这一努力的目的是引发或催化对人类灵魂的发现--不是通过形而上学或宗教的主观视角，而是通过科学原理的无可辩驳的应用。

这些收集的作品是这个过程的各个方面。我是这些作品的翻译者，这些作品源自不同的空间或维度层面，被称为支流区。这些作品具有催化作用，旨在帮助个人转移他们的意识，以便更有效地进入他们自己的精神目的，特别是与发现大门户有关的。

大门 "是我们用来描述人类灵魂的无可辩驳的科学发现的术语。这是一个人类正在稳步接近的事件，它的到来估计会在2080年的时间附近。这些材料，以及其他类似的材料，将成为那些属于大门户发现的化身灵魂的催化剂。

我可以理解，这对你们中的许多人来说可能是科幻小说，但它仍然是一个即将到来的现实，并标志着人类基本社会结构的深刻转变。大门户的发现实际上是进入一个新的多维宇宙的门户，表明人类不是一个孤立的生命 "补丁"，而是跨越多个宇宙和维度的惊人的多样化生命形式组合的一部分。

这与海洋学家首次开始调查海洋深处并在被认为不可能存在生命的地方发现新的生命物种并无不同。根据我们的估计，一个类似的现象--但在一个更深刻的层面上--将在大约80年后发生，因为科学和灵魂相碰撞，发现并与全人类分享超越物理层面的近乎无限的生命形式的现实。

随着新的科学--首先是粒子物理学和分子生物学--开始大幅重组宗教、政府、教育和文化等社会机构，地球上的信仰体系将在发现大门户之后发生灾难性的变化。这是人类在过去11000年里一直在朝着这个方向发展的发现。

我在这里是为了帮助这一发现。如果你在自己的生活中应用这些材料，你也是如此。

从我的世界到你的世界。

詹姆斯

咏叹调的材料来自哪里，或来自谁？

这些材料的确切来源仍然是个谜。然而，从2001年2月起，一个名叫 "詹姆斯-马胡 "的人站出来，成为本网站所有内容的唯一创造者。通过阅读或聆听他在本网站创造者部分的访谈音频，可以了解更多关于詹姆斯的身份和目的。在WingMakers.com网站的介绍部分的历史页面是另一个了解这些材料如何产生的背景故事的好地方。也许最好的见解是在名为《WingMakers作品集》第一卷的书中。


WingMakers网站是什么时候推出的？
1998年11月23日，格林威治标准时间（GMT）晚上11点。


WingMakers是一个邪教吗？

没有。没有会员资格，没有组织，没有要求，没有内部圈子，没有中心教义，没有领导层，没有建筑物，没有会议，没有董事会，也没有借其魅力产生什叶派成员的个性。詹姆斯-马胡一直非常明确地表示要保持WingMakers的低调、地下、清醒、不可知论和个人。没有大肆宣传。WingMakers.com每年会发出2-3次关于新内容的更新，仅此而已。

为什么詹姆斯决定写小说，而不是像形而上学领域的其他大师或专家那样以非小说的方式写一切？

詹姆斯创造了神话般的环境，在这种环境中，深刻的精神内容可以通过激活读者的想象力而被同化，而虚构的环境提供了实现这一目标的最佳途径。小说允许读者考虑各种可能性，但不把著作看成是绝对或权威的。它提供了探索，而没有灌输的感觉。

咏叹调材料是古老的。它们不属于任何组织，当然也不属于任何个人。在詹姆斯看来，它们应该像它们本身一样纯粹地表现出来--没有任何形式的修饰或个性或组织印记。就其对任何现有宗教或精神信仰的取向而言，它们是不可知论的。它们不是自我帮助或个人发展的材料。它们是促进主权整体意识状态的催化剂。

创翼材料背后有一个组织吗？

詹姆斯决心不建立任何类型的组织来推广他的作品，或试图将追随者组织成某种教会或会员，或将他定位为某种其他人应该跟随的精神领袖。他所分享的材料是为个人服务的。他的著作、艺术、音乐、诗歌、视频等的频率和细微差别是他称为 "大门户 "的更大倡议的一部分。

大门户是对人类灵魂的无可辩驳的科学发现。詹姆斯写了大量关于这一发现的文章，在他的材料中可以找到参考资料。他最近的小说《Quantusum》非常清晰地描绘了这一不可思议的发现及其影响。许多Lyricus的材料也对 "大门户 "进行了详细的定义。

为什么WingMakers网站出售产品？

制作音乐CD、书籍、艺术印刷品等有很大的成本，而全球对詹姆斯的作品有需求。来自全球各地的人们（据最后统计有89个国家）感觉到了这些材料的特殊性，并纷纷订购产品。正如人们多次所说，"内容为王"。内容是人们消费的主要东西之一，帮助他们找到生活的意义。詹姆斯为他的内容注入了一种特殊的频率，许多人--甚至在潜意识中--认为它具有催化和转化作用。他们想要这种内容的高分辨率文件，而这是有代价的。

没有人在赚大钱。WingMakers的设计或规模不是为了成为一个大企业；它的目的是为启蒙社区提供服务，并希望能达到收支平衡。这就是它的范围。网络经理（Mark Hempel）和他的妻子处理所有的电子邮件、订单包装、库存管理、与供应商合作、会计等等。他们在自己的房子里做这些事情。

值得一提的是，这些材料中没有任何公司参与。没有出版商在这些材料的中间，以这种或那种方式指导它们，试图使它们对公众更 "有市场"。对于这种类型和质量的材料，这是很常见的。出版商、工作室、制片人、分销商、零售商、代理商等都插入到创作过程中，试图使材料在商业上更加成功。

这是一个简单的过程。詹姆斯提供材料；他的网站经理将这些材料发布在网站上，并处理对最终客户的履行事宜。就这样，总的来说。许多公司，无论大小，都与WingMakers接触，寻求将这些材料商业化，而詹姆斯拒绝了每一个提议。詹姆斯不是受金钱的驱使。如果他是，他就会追求这些商业建议中的一些。

我应该从哪里开始接触这些材料？它们是如此庞大。什么是最好的开始？

扫描一下材料，对各种元素进行采样，看看什么能引起你内心的共鸣，这也许是一个好主意。大多数WingMakers爱好者都认为《古箭计划》这本书是作品的核心，也是一个很好的起点。它为其他材料提供了最好的基础，但没有正确或错误的方法。

有多少人去过网站？

自推出以来约有790万次访问，但不可能说有多少重复访问。一个更好的估计是，自网站推出以来，大约有145万名独立访客（来自全球各地）来到网站，而这种兴趣是在没有花一毛钱进行营销或推广的情况下产生的。

该文本是否可以打印和分发？

是的，文字和绘画可以打印出来供个人使用，但不能用于商业目的。这些材料都是受版权保护的。因此，个人打印出文本供自己欣赏是可以的，但你不能合法地分发这些材料用于商业目的。

我碰到了一份归属于荣格的哲学文件。在公共领域中是否有比网站上更多的商会哲学？

在WingMakers.com网站内，是已经发布的全部原创内容。你在这个网站上找到的所有内容都来自于詹姆斯，代表了他已经公开的内容。这些内容是唯一真实的WingMakers材料，它的版权受到美国国会图书馆的保护。任何归属于WingMakers的信息，如果没有版权通知，应被视为可能是不真实的，如果它不是在WingMakers.com、Lyricus.org、EventTemples.com、SovereignIntegral.org或SpiritState.com（都是詹姆斯-马胡的官方网站）中找到的，那么它可能是不真实的或被修改过。许多人声称自己是Lyricus的官员或詹姆斯的代表，但詹姆斯并没有被任何人代表。

詹姆斯与公司关系最密切的是Planetwork出版社，他的出版商。他的几部小说也在Sumbola.com上以数字形式出版。

有一些归属于马克-亨普尔的电子邮件，声称他写这些材料的目的是为了创作一部电影或一种沉浸式多媒体艺术形式（IMAF）。这是真的吗？

据我所知，至少有10封电子邮件是由我（Mark Hempel）发出的。所有这些帖子和电子邮件都出现在1998年11月WingMakers网站启动后不久。其中一个声称该网站是一个骗局。另一个声称我是在抢夺创造所有内容的功劳。第三个人声称，我开发的材料是为了推出一部电影。第四种说法是我开发了一种实验性的艺术形式，称为IMAF。其余的也是类似的性质。在任何情况下，我没有写这些电子邮件，我也不知道是谁写的，或者有人出于什么目的冒充我。在1998年（甚至在今天），用电子邮件冒充某人是一件非常简单的事情。

当WingMakers网站推出时，引起了一阵骚动，因为詹姆斯在他的内容方面推出了一个强大的事件串。这就像把一块大石头扔进一个平静的湖里。这些内容是匿名的。它以一种不寻常的方式被整合。它对秘密政府的见解得到了许多专家的证实。甚至它的许多预言也被证明是真实的。有许多证据表明，我们的政府成员不希望这些材料的某些特征被公开......比如聂鲁达访谈录。

是否有创翼材料的学习小组？

如果你进入WingMakers学习小组的网站，你可以了解到现有的学习小组，甚至可以获得材料来开始你自己的学习小组。这个网站与詹姆斯或他的材料没有关系，但参与的人都是WingMakers材料的爱好者，并选择分享他们创建学习小组的经验。

似乎现在詹姆斯-马胡已经公布了他的名字，并且接受了采访，他不能再被认为是 "匿名 "了。我想我的问题是：这真的是詹姆斯的身份吗，真的只有一个人自己把这些大量的内容放在一起吗？

詹姆斯仍然是匿名的。这样做是他的选择。虽然他提供了一个名字，但没有人应该认为这是他的真名。至于你的另一个问题，是的，詹姆斯说过，所有WingMakers的内容都是由他产生的，但他是从其他空间 "翻译 "过来的。也就是说，他正在调整他能看到和听到的频率，然后使用当前的工具、技术和工艺将这些内容带入物理表现。这不是一种艺术表达。它是一项任务。这个使命，在个人层面上，是为人们创造催化工具，开始提升他们的行为智能，并一点点接近詹姆斯所说的意识的下一个进化，即主权整体意识状态。在社会层面上，它们是引领人类走向大门户的路标和备忘录。


你为什么决定通过南湾集团的马克-亨普尔出版你的作品，因为你没有见过他本人？

我的同事莎拉通过一个共同的联系人知道了马克。他被推荐为离散和值得信赖的人，并且拥有启动和维护网站以及未来将引入的其他技术项目所需的技术能力。我还希望通过像马克这样的个人而不是公司来发布，以确保对项目的完全控制。

你怎么能把这么大的工作交给一个完全陌生的人--一个你不知道其诚信的人呢？

我想我在之前的回答中基本回答了这个问题，但我要补充的是，我对那些长期以来表现稳定的人有信任。我从一开始就看着马克如何处理一切，直到交往六个月后，我才开始把重要的责任托付给他。他赢得了我的信任，这并不是立即就能得到的。

介绍莎拉-德-罗斯内作为你和马克之间的 "中间人 "的目的是什么？

莎拉使我能够集中精力进行内容创作和教学。她还回答我收到的许多邮件，并支持马克在前线的工作。

除了地点、名字和日期之外，故事的事实是否正确？

我想你所指的故事是ACIO和Ancient Arrow网站。故事的这一部分是基于事实的。我不会泄露我是如何知道这些事情的，但如果你详细研究过这个故事，肯定不难确定。有一些技术可以用来保证信息的安全。

我们从政府那里得到的都是关于宇航员、外星人、掩盖真相等的半真半假的说法。这不就是同样的事情吗？

创翼者的资料并不是为了揭示政府对UFO和外星人的压制。这方面的信息已经很充分了，而且有比我更专注、更有能力的组织在研究这个领域。WingMakers的资料关注的是人类对人类灵魂无可辩驳的科学发现。这是它唯一的焦点。所有其他的元素，无论是故事、艺术还是数学，都是为了催化那些将在未来实现这一发现的人，并使之持久化。这份材料正是献给这些人的，它将吸引他们，就像一棵宏伟的树吸引老鹰筑巢一样。
[这里詹姆斯指的是大门户的发现和那些将为该发现作出贡献的人。Ed.](所有Ed.言论均由John Berges撰写。)

你说，"WingMakers已经与人类交流了大约一万一千年。"为什么现在要发布这些材料？这是否与通过互联网给予个人的言论自由有关--人类终于可以在全球范围内向所有人自由发言，并完全绕过腐败政府给我们的谎言、宣传和欺骗？

支流区现在被释放，因为在未来三代的SECU（中央宇宙的主权实体）在地球上出生，他们是发现大门户的代表，而造翼者的神话将是催化他们觉醒的主要感官数据流之一。
造翼者通过我在你的前两个问题中提到的同样的SBL技术来观察一个有生命的星球。[见感官双定位。 编辑]利用这种洞察力，我们可以高度准确地确定一个物种何时准备接受其加速，而当这个时间发生时，Lyricus会部署一个教师团队到该星球。

大约一万一千年前，这个团队化身为人类的身体，成为地球上第一批高等科学、艺术和形而上学的老师。我现在不想再多说什么了，但是这些最初的Lyricus成员在人类的基因思维中植入了发现大门户的目的。目前，人类对这一目的的理解还很模糊，但在大约50年后会变得清晰。

我不认为WingMakers的材料（WMM）一定是针对 "深奥的学生 "的。显然，正在撒下一张更广泛的网。这是正确的吗？

WingMakers的材料不是针对任何一个群体。更为相反的是，有某些群体和个人被引导到你所说的WMM的催化材料。事件串就像数学算法，拥有一个共鸣点，当受到某种频率的影响时，可以诱导选定的个人或在较小的程度上诱导整个群体无意识地寻求WMM。这种诱导就像一种微妙的香味，在你没有意识到要体验花朵的情况下，把你吸引到一个覆盖着花朵的目的地。
说 "更广泛的网"，如你所说，是为那些深奥的实践之外的人设计的，这是真的。这只是因为那些沉浸在密教中的人往往会被灌输一种微妙的、但仍然引人注目的动机，即保护他们认为真实的或至少是最有可能的密教教义。因此，前任教师留下的深奥文字作品激活了他们的灵感。当他们接触到与这些深奥文本没有直接联系的音乐、诗歌和艺术时，他们的保护性反射被唤起，材料不会被吸收，而是倾向于分析和比较。

吸收WMM就像人们在外面时吸收阳光一样。没有人需要测量设备或镜片来吸收太阳光；他们只需要在这些光线的路径上。他们需要定位自己以接受阳光。这就是WMM的情况。更广泛的网络实际上是关于新化身的灵魂，他们将作为其编码的事件串的结果，无意识地定位自己以接受这些材料。


尽管对某些人有好处，但你怎么能昧着良心允许wingmakers.com继续催化人们成为新时代的自动机？

咏叹调的内容不是在催化自动装置。恰恰相反，它是将人们从 "新时代 "的既定结构中分离出来，让他们认识到存在于自己体内的新能量，而不是 "新时代"。

造翼者的材料与地球上现今的信仰体系有什么联系？他们是先来的，还是后来的，或者他们对人类的其他宗教有某种启发？

人类思维最常见的特征之一是将一种经验与另一种经验进行比较。人们认为，通过比较一个物体、经验、事件或人，可以更好地理解它，这种推理是正确的。然而，就七个支流区而言，这种推理是不成立的。
这七个支流区，我们将统称为WingMakers的材料，并不是哲学文本。有些人试图将这些著作与《圣经》、《古兰经》、《乌兰图亚之书》、上师指示等相提并论。也有人会把采访和书中的信息与调查记者的非虚构作品相比较。对比WingMakers的材料不一定会产生理解，但更有可能是混淆。

WingMakers的材料是以一种不同于地球上任何表现的方式设计的。它是一个编码的感官数据流的集合，注定要用于一个消费者技术平台，这个平台刚刚开始在开发实验室内孵化。然而，即使在没有这个技术平台的情况下，个人也会意识到有一个深刻的转变正在发生。有些东西正在 "重新洗牌 "他们的心理 "牌"。

我鼓励任何将自己的意识沉浸在这些材料中的人，在吸收这些材料时，在一段时间内不要进行比较。支流区所编码的信息比人类大脑所能获取和理解的要多。如果一个人参与比较，他们可能没有参与支流区的更深层次的意义，在这个层面上，编码的信息被揭示。

顺便说一下，我刚才说的并不是暗示编码的信息必须通过有意识的意志和努力从支流区夺取出来。检测编码信息是一件微妙的事情。它需要灵活的智慧、开放的心态、沉思的视角和计算过的观察的好奇心。这不是一场意志的较量，也不是心智战胜物质。而且它很少在杂乱无章的比较中被揭示出来。

至于WingMakers的材料与当今地球上的信仰体系的联系，没有什么联系，因为这些材料不是由地球上的教师创造的，也不仅仅是教师的话语。它们是来自地外教学秩序的编码感官数据流，有一个非常具体的目的。地球上现今的信仰体系是为一个不同的、更普遍的目的服务的，即道德调节、社区建设和精神准备。只有在这最后一个元素中才有任何联系。


在对聂鲁达博士的第三次采访中，有一个说法是存在一种Corteum技术，通过诱导丘脑皮层系统内的功能群，将流体智能提高到 "超级 "人类水平。这个功能群是什么（电、生物），WingMakers的材料（即音乐、艺术、诗歌）可以用在这种方式上吗？

你成功地触及了WingMakers材料中一个微妙的组成部分。这个故事包含的情节是对事实发生的虚构叙述。例如，正如你所指出的，第三次采访对功能集群进行了披露，但Corteum技术是对WingMakers的材料如何能够--如哲学论文中所描述的--刺激大脑某些区域的功能集群这一事实发生的虚构叙述。
大脑本身被划分为区域，在区域内又被划分为子集。一些子集之间的互动比其他子集多，这些子集被称为功能集群。大脑被设计成有各种电路，当代大脑研究人员已经确定了其中的三种电路，他们称之为收敛、发散和回响电路。

一个功能团可以有一个分歧的电路，将神经活动传导到大脑或中枢神经系统的外围区域。感官信息（如声音、符号和图像）可以产生，刺激丘脑皮层系统内正是这样一个功能集群的时间形成，催化了预先指定的意识转变。

你是否可以把这种意识的转变等同于诱发流体智能的增加，这取决于其他因素。这不是一个单一的动态核心，而是一个更大的动态系统的组成部分，它不仅将个人与他们的人类灵魂意识联系在一起，而且还与遗传思想联系在一起。

在丘脑复合体内有一个被称为层内核（ILN）的子集。ILN神经元在整个大脑皮层中广泛冒险，支配着每个皮层部分。它们以环形（圆环形）的方式分布在每个丘脑的中心区域，使丘脑系统受到广泛的影响。ILN的激活是发现大门户的一个重要关键。

WingMakers的音乐、艺术和文字符号都是为了刺激ILN区域，作为人类意识和遗传心灵的同步机制。我意识到这很难理解，但随着未来二十年对这种大脑功能的研究，将证明ILN是一个关键的 "引擎"，使人的灵魂意识与遗传心智的细粒度意识同步，使遗传心智可以随心所欲地短时间内进入。

在丘脑皮层系统中，有一个科学家称之为丘脑网状核（nRt）的东西。神经科学界普遍认为，nRt在丘脑和大脑皮层之间的神经信息流的明智调节中起着重要作用。不为人知的是，特定的感官信息（光频、声频、节奏同步、超低频、符号图像）如何影响ILN和nRt系统的相互作用，形成一个混合功能群，增强流体智能和对基因思维的可及性。这一发现还需要二十年的时间，但它会发生，而WingMakers将在这一发现中发挥关键作用。


我们所有的想法来自哪里？
感官数据引发思想。行动和想法的比较引发新的想法。新的想法引发新的行动。这个循环在上升的螺旋、横向的螺旋或下降的螺旋中无休止地重复。这就是为什么感觉数据的质量是如此关键。
就像我们有身体的母亲和父亲，他们是我们身体DNA的种子，我们是否也有一个精神的母亲和父亲，他们是我们精神DNA的种子？如果没有，它们--精神的DNA--是如何产生和获得的？如果是的话，有什么方法可以与这个灵性的母亲和父亲联系或沟通？"什么方法 "不一定是指冥想技术？感官数据流对此有帮助吗？
DNA与其他有机化合物没有什么不同，因为它是由超出我们三维观察和分析范围的亚原子结构组成的。人类DNA的平台或 "骨架 "结构是由相对于我们超宇宙的第一源的原型组成的。我不会把这种原型称为精神上的母亲或父亲，就像房子的蓝图被赋予了这种品质一样。WingMakers的材料产生振动（光和声音），在亚原子层面上 "混合"，并能够改变支配精神意志的DNA集群中的倾向性。在这种情况下，决心将时间雕刻成精神体验，而不是简单的物理或物质体验。

遗传思想（GM）是否使用存在于 "万物之源"（ATI）图书馆中的符号和意象；这种意象是否至少在某种程度上与绘画、意象和字形相呼应？我有时会看到金银白背景的字形，就像画中一样，我怀疑这些字与ATI和GM有关，或者来自ATI和GM。打个比方，如果 "万物之灵 "是宇宙图书馆，那么从 "人类工具 "的角度来看，"遗传心智 "似乎是它最常光顾的客户；它使用具有普遍性的图像，以人类在漫长岁月中赋予它的语言与人类交流。这基本上是正确的，或者是一个合适的比喻吗？你能阐明遗传心灵和万物之灵之间的关系、联系和沟通系统以及它们各自的意象吗？WMM在为人类带来来自ATI和GM的视觉图像方面似乎是独一无二的。这是第一次吗？

遗传思想是一个储存库；它不是其自身资源的积极 "使用者"。它更类似于一个图书馆，它的顾客是在不同程度上能够接触到它的书籍的人类个体。密室绘画中使用的意象并不是特别受到遗传思想的启发，也不是取自遗传思想。有一些共同的符号，但这是由于几何学的普遍性和预先存在的状态。
一切都是[见WingMakers的词汇表。]代表了一个比遗传思想更大规模的图书馆。原则上，除了规模之外，这两者是相似的。一切都是与多元宇宙和其中的宇宙精神有关，而基因心智则与超级宇宙七中的类人物种有关。万物之灵的意象被编入高维语言，反过来又被编码到支流区的原始作品中。然后，这些作品在频率上下降到WingMakers网站和音乐CD中的材料。

WingMakers材料的独特之处在于其编码的微妙性和材料交织的方式。正是这种材料（图像、符号、音乐、频率、诗歌、元语言、哲学、宇宙学等）的交织，以及它们激活对第一源头和整体性导航者的深层感知的方式，使这些材料区别于以往的版本。

所有的东西，就其本质而言，是多方面的（轮中之轮），为了分配这种多维的复杂性，分配必须包括声音和光，并将其协调成文字、音乐和图片。然后，这些元素必须被协调起来，以触发人类基因组中的特定共鸣，这些共鸣处于休眠状态，因为在大多数情况下，当今的文化并没有激活或触及人类DNA的这些受体。


遗传思想有结构吗？如果有，它的形状是什么？

所有的物理结构都是由几何形状组成的。然而，遗传心智不是一个物理结构或地方。当你进入更高一级的心灵，也就是遗传心灵所在的地方，几何学就不再局限于三维的静态范式了。用三维语言来解释它的非物理结构是不可能的，因为遗传心智是有机的、动态的，而且总是在变化。换句话说，不存在有代表性的 "快照"。


如果每个房间有一幅画，而二十三（二十四）个房间，那么多余的艺术品等从何而来？

有七个支流区，我从一个时间和空间的维度进行翻译，它起源于--象征性地讲--时间/空间连续体的非人类部分。古代之箭网站是这七个 "跨维度 "网站之一，它已被翻译成人类术语（丘脑皮层系统可以接收和处理的感官信息）并以各种形式传播（CD、网络等）。就 "古箭 "网站而言，有二十四个腔室，因为这个网站关注的是人类神经解剖结构的遗传结构。
这个网站被编码为遗传学的特定信息，因此它的结构呈现出单螺旋的形式，其腔室象征着休眠的、尚未被激活的蛋白质集群，将意识转移到人类的六感存在。

在将于明年发行的该书第二部分中，将更好地理解第二十四室。[在写这篇文章时，《古箭计划》的第二部分还没有发布。对这一延迟没有给出解释。编者按】。］还有一篇哲学论文，将有助于澄清古箭遗址的基因象征意义。此外，第二十四幅密室画将在2001年7月底前发布；它是这个谜题的一个重要部分。

其余六个遗址的符号结构与古箭遗址不同，但也有某些相似之处。它们都有艺术、音乐、诗歌、语言、科学和哲学的综合体，因为这就是支流区的性质。有些遗址更强调音乐而不是诗歌，或艺术而不是科学。这取决于支流区的象征性重点而有所不同。七个支流区像珍珠一样串在一起，揭示了为发现大门户而需要的基本创新。

我建议任何有兴趣了解这些遗址结构的人都应该阅读《古箭》一书的第三章和商会的四篇哲学论文。


一旦发现这七个支流区域，人类将觉醒到大门户。这是否意味着WingMakers的材料将唤醒人类精神/心灵的七个区域，这将导致人类在2012年转移到第四维度？

冒着显得有点急功近利的风险，七个支流区并不是被发现，而是被揭示。这个启示是一个新的感官数据流的逐步发放，它被编码为许多 "触发器"，将深入触及未来三代在地球上化身的特定人类。这些感官数据流实际上将使个人的超然目的具体化，并使个人的心灵能够接触到它。这种接触可能是无辜的，因为它使个人选择了对人类基因组进行科学探索的职业，也可能是强大的，因为它唤醒了主权的整体意识状态。
在七个支流区被揭示的同时，大门户也被发现。Lyricus的七个学科都与一个支流区相连。换句话说，其中一个支流区被称为 "古箭 "遗址，主要是研究人类基因组。下一个将被揭示的站点侧重于宇宙学科学，以此类推。每一个重点领域都巧妙地表现（编码）在其各自站点的感官数据流中，并在接受者的头脑中引发觉醒。

[Lyricus的七个学科是遗传学、新科学（宇宙学）、形而上学、感官数据流、心理协调、文化进化、主权整体。编者按】。］


在亚利桑那州的WingMakers网站是真实的，而且这些诗歌、音乐和绘画真的来自这里吗？是否有任何其他的地点被激活？如果是的话，最近在东方湖的发现是另一个WingMakers遗址吗？埃及的情况如何--记录大厅是WingMakers的遗址吗？乌鲁鲁是另一个遗址吗？

我相信你所指的遗址是位于新墨西哥州北部的古箭遗址。诚然，各大洲都有实体遗址（如上，如下）。
然而，这些地点与我在这个故事中描述的地点不同。在某种程度上，我这样做是为了纪念这些圣地，但主要是我对描写实际的物理地点不感兴趣，而对转述七个支流区的准确描写感兴趣。


支流区是纯粹的精神性的，还是物理事件在开放这些方面起到了一定的作用？

七个支流区是作为调查和知识传播的地方而存在的。它们是中央种族的创造，更确切地说，是Lyricus的创造。虽然可以说它们存在于七个超级宇宙的最内部，但它们被输出到每个星系，有点像输出一个图书馆。因此，每个星系都拥有七个支流区，这些支流区是由存在于宇宙最内部的原型版本铸造的，与该特定星系有关。每个支流区都根据特定超级宇宙的类人物种的独特特征进行调整，在某种程度上，也包括星系。
虽然地球上的物理事件和人类的进化状况对这七个支流区的物理启示的时间有影响，但就个人而言，它们并不决定这些神秘目的地的启示。


你如何将支流区从一个维度翻译成我们的维度？你是以翻译者的身份生产所有的材料，还是以创造者的身份，或者两者都是？WingMakers的材料被编码是什么意思？这一点是如何做到的？

七个银河系支流区存在于银河系的最中心点附近，使得人类无法进入。这就是需要翻译器的主要原因。另一个原因是，支流区的振动率被特意加快，以确保只有那些具有兼容振动的实体可以进入。在整个银河系，有一些类人物种的成员在他们的梦境或冥想过程中参加这些场所。
要把这些网站从原来的维度翻译到地球，或任何其他三维星球，而不改变其内容是不可能的。这是因为原始材料的振动率必须被减速，而在这个减速过程中，会发生变化。从技术上讲，这个过程不太类似于从一种语言翻译到另一种语言，而更类似于从一个较高的调子或振动率转到一个较低的调子。你可以把这七个站点看作是知识库，以多种媒介（声音、光、知识、语言、数学等）专注于Lyricus的七个学科中的每个学科。这七门学科的表达方式不同，但每门学科都包含多种媒介，提高和强调综合知识是一个包括艺术、形而上学和科学的光谱，而正确地统一起来，这个光谱是揭开大门户的关键。

相当于古箭遗址，在银河系核心内，包含了三维艺术形式，始终处于运动状态。它们对声波压力以及在现场的人的思想做出反应。目前没有任何方法可以在地球上复制这一点。因此，这些画必须在时间和空间上固定下来。我决定这种固定的状态，所以，在这种情况下，我是一个 "创造者"。然而，我有丰富的经验，基于对色彩振动、人类感知系统、视觉皮层的复杂性、形式的联想价值以及催化新的接受领域的方法的研究，做出这些解释。

在许多方面，声音需要一个类似的过程。主要的主题被转为可听的频率，但乐器的作用不能被复制。银河系支流区的声音产生不是来自乐器，而是由思想形式设定的粒子。即使在这个斜线的描述中，我也只是暗示了真正的过程。这将需要太长的时间来描述。要知道的重要因素是，我被允许在艺术上有自主权，使用人类的乐器、人类的作曲技术和人类的人声将主题转变成新的结构。这些元素为音乐提供了一个锚点，使它们更容易被人的耳朵接受。从这些描述中，我想你对我使用的过程有了一丝了解。

至于编码和如何完成的问题，我只能告诉你，在WingMakers的材料中，有一些微妙的信息被编码，作为一个导航系统，引导人们深入到每个网站或支流区的目的。这是选择过程的一部分，完全与 "整体导航 "意识有关。这方面的更多信息我不能透露。

还有另一种编码形式，这不是深奥的，这个元素与人类工具与材料的互动有关。音乐、艺术、石刻和文本都被编码为数学和形而上学的点缀，这些点缀可以通过互动技术获得，其中一些已经在第四篇哲学论文中披露。通过这些互动，人类乐器解码信息，帮助它过渡到探索性的能量系统，在那里可以获得更深的洞察力。

能否请您更详细地描述什么是支流区，其目的是什么？

银河系支流区是Lyricus的知识库。它们容纳了当地的Lyricus工作人员、研究中心、教学设施和各种工具，我们相信--在这种特殊情况下--这些工具将帮助人类集中技术和精力来追求大门户的目标。正如我之前所报告的，银河系核心内有七个支流区。这些支流区与构成Lyricus "催化工具库 "的七个主要学科有关。
[詹姆斯的以下回答包含了 "SECU "的缩写。为了清楚起见，我把詹姆斯对SECU的定义提出来。该定义将在本文件后面的 "外星生物 "中出现。Ed.]"你们所说的人类，我们称之为中央宇宙的主权实体（SECU-发音为SeeQue）。SECU是阿尔法和欧米茄。他们不受时间的限制，也不受身体的装饰物的约束。他们是最原始的形式，完成并磨练了他们的创造者的完美，在这一点上，我们都是一样的。"

Lyricus能够跟踪和监测SECU（中央宇宙的主权整体[原文如此]）[主权实体。 编者注]，无论他们居住在什么物理结构中。当我们判断某个SECU准备妥当时，他们（他们的整体性导航员）就会被送到我们的一个培训中心，这与你在地球上能想象到的任何中心都不同。我之所以使用 "培训中心 "这个词，只是因为我想不出还有什么可以描述它们。候选人不一定是有灵性的人，他们在个性、身体或气质方面也不是人类的典范。然而，他们是以人类形式运作的高级SECU，通常对他们的使命和目的没有意识。

这些幸运的实体被护送离开他们的人类工具，并被引导到最适合他们目的和任务的支流区。他们通常以对话的形式接受教育--与Lyricus的论述所描述的不一样。他们被允许询问大师，而大师则被允许对相关主题进行阐释。

毫不奇怪，爱因斯坦就是这样一个由Lyricus大师们参加的SECU。他被允许通过与一位大师的对话来制定 "他的 "理论。当他回到他的人类工具中时，这些经验和知识被保存在他的高级头脑中，然后需要一个触发器将其引入意识。

这些触发器是精心安排的事件串，由负责SECU的主人通过一个我们称之为--再次，我尽力翻译--明晰的重新定位的过程进行协调。这个过程要求在支流区时获得的信息以一种可重新收集的状态过滤到意识中。为了实现这一目标，爱因斯坦博士将经历一个事件或EDSS（编码数据感觉流），诱发或触发对种子记忆的回忆。种子记忆是清晰的重新定位过程中最关键的部分，因为只有它才有足够的力量将新的知识引向人类的意识状态。我已经严重简化了这一过程，而语言的描述是非常令人烦恼的限制。我最好在这里停下来，免得把你完全弄糊涂。

物理翻译的支流区对地球上的SECU至关重要，原因是它们是种子记忆的最确定的催化剂。要把超意识的知识转译出来，并将其减速以便由人类工具进行有意识的回忆是非常困难的。而这将在未来一百年内以更高的频率被要求，所以支流区正被提升到一个新的水平--EDSS--将触发种子记忆。


如果WingMakers的故事既是真实的又是虚构的，我们如何辨别哪一个是真实的？如果 "造翼者 "的身份是相当真实的（即真实），它怎么可能也是神话（即虚构）？

佛陀指出"所有的现实都是一个神话。神话变得越来越接近于现实"。一个人的辨别力的质量与他们加速向主权整体意识状态运动的能力成正比。像WingMakers这样的哲学体系需要高水平的辨别力，因此它通过混合真理和虚构，同时在多个层面进行教学。
这份材料不适合心智薄弱或懒惰的人。它在许多不同的层面上极具挑战性，辨别力就是其中之一。有大量的信息被编码到艺术和音乐中，绕过了有意识的头脑。这样一来，就不需要辨别力。然而，"古箭计划 "的故事确实是基于对事实情景的后天洞察力而虚构的。


与聂鲁达博士的访谈三提到了真正的美国和俄罗斯公司的技术。这些技术起源于ACIO的研究。我已经检查过了，关于Mig-29和互联网压缩技术的信息是经得起推敲的。你自己、马克和南湾集团提出这些指控，是否有可能遭到法律诉讼？

是的，但这是一种可以接受的风险。

为什么故事情节从安德森博士变成了聂鲁达博士，为什么故事线中的时间变化？

这个故事被修改了，以追踪市场内对《古箭》故事的挪用情况。还有比你在问题中提到的更细微的变化。自首次发表以来，主要（编码）内容都没有被修改过。

如果ACIO打算不让公众知道，为什么WingMakers允许ACIO发现AA的网站？

ACIO是唯一能够解码该内容的地球上的组织。因为聂鲁达博士在ACIO工作，而且众所周知他是该发现公开发布的关键设计师，所以该发现必须在ACIO发生。

为什么WingMakers不使用他们的时间旅行能力来确保地图文物的种植没有导致学生的生命损失，从而有效地使这一事件的发生和随后WingMakers的信息中出现 "乌云 "的机会消失。你会考虑改变故事线，抹去发现神器的学生的无谓死亡吗？

每一个重要的发现都有一个 "乌云 "罩着它。重要的发现是维度和深奥的，这是生命戏剧的内在要求--也就是说，它们包括外在的和深奥的生命规则，其中就有牺牲人的生命。学生们代表了无辜的发现者的隐喻，为了强调他们发现的重要性，他们必须被牺牲。

造翼者是否在同一时间在所有的七大支流遗址留下了材料，以便依次找到？还是他们在一段时期内留下的？

WingMakers的网站--七个中的每一个--将按照特定的顺序进行翻译。请记住，每个网站都有一个中心主题，与Lyricus的七个学科有关。这七门学科--总的来说--是那些在大约三十五到四十年后化身为科学家、学者、心理学家和艺术家的人的触发点，他们将发现和传播大门户。


在回答之前的问题时，你说 "古箭 "的故事是真实的，因为有 "可以应用的技术来保证信息的安全。你是指遥感，以及与之相关的重放技术吗？

这些信息是基于通过一种远程观察的形式获得的事实数据，我的教学组织将其称为感官双定位。SBL与经典的RV不同，因为它与更高的心智有关，而不是星空视觉的精神渠道。由于这种区别，SBL允许人们分析动机和意图，除了RV技术所承认的感官/行动环境之外。SBL也更注重主动的感觉通道选择，而不是像RV那样的反应性选择。

在实体WingMakers的材料（诗歌、音乐、哲学、艺术等）中，什么是对我们意识最有力的催化剂？居住在银河系支流区的乙醚版本或原件也是如此吗？

这取决于个人，取决于他们对不同振动的反应，以及他们先天的眼脑与耳脑的学习偏好。然而，与这种评估无关，耳脑作为意识和转化的催化剂比眼脑更强大。原因是音乐的谐波和泛音可以体现出比绘画或文字符号更多的编码信息。
当与第一源头的原始光和声音对比时，这也是事实。声音振动被认为比宇宙之光对意识有更深的联系和催化作用，如果没有其他原因，那就是它们比光的结构更容易吸收和同化，因为光的结构往往太强烈，无法吸收和整合。


我对这些画作感兴趣，尤其是其中的符号。这些可以翻译成英文吗？它们是DK在其著作中提到的Senzar符号吗？

森扎尔语除了有自己的字母外，还可以用密码字来表示，它符合表意文字而不是音节的性质。森扎尔语作为一种语言，是由中央种族带到地球上的。原因很简单。表意符号语言可以在一个字符中传达一个极其复杂的概念。它的效率很高，可以有效地进行编码，以实现高度针对性的传输。具有重大意义的宇宙学和数学概念可以简化为符号的呈现，但颜色和次要矩阵的上下文意义使符号的全部意义显现出来，因此其编码是完整的。
换句话说，你可以看一下第二十四室画的一个具体符号（例如，画的左上部分的垂直矩阵中的第二个主要字符）。

如果脱离其框架，这个特定的字符意味着一件事，这将转变成梵文，但当在其背景矩阵中查看时，它被提升到Senzar，其意义被编码为代表人类工具中的整体性导航者。

森扎尔是一种在字母、数学符号和音符之间流动的语言。它是一种综合语言，有时被称为光的通用语言或第一来源的标志。


阿尔-比勒克说，我们看到和买到的画不是真正的画，"......真正的画是分类的"。是这样吗？是否有部分画作被修改过，还是都是百分之百从Lyricus转来的真迹？

在WingMakers网站上展示的 "室内绘画"，是对真实绘画的翻译。原作位于银河系银河中心附近的支流区。原始 "画作 "是由一种先进的技术制成的光子动画，该技术允许艺术按照音乐的要求进行智能变形。换句话说，音乐是使画作生动化的引擎。艺术品存储的原始环境要求我，即翻译者，对画作进行 "快照"，以最佳方式静态地表现动态图像。
我向你保证，这些原创作品没有被任何政府组织 "分类"。它们只是存在于一个不同的维度，在不同的感官范围内可见。DVD "时空的沉思 "试图捕捉到这些画作在其原生环境中实际呈现的某种感觉。


"Octavio Fifteen "是85 65，与 "The Earth Kumara "相对应。你之前警告过我关于深奥的数字学，但科尔特姆确实与天狼星有关，而且根据DK，萨纳特-库马拉（数值为120）确实与天狼星的逻各斯有特殊关系。这里发生了一些事情。这要么意味着对你的故事的深奥含义有重要意义，要么只是语言结构的巧合，加上我过度活跃的想象力。你能告诉我这是什么吗？这段通信让我困扰的是，（至少到第八章为止）十五岁似乎是一个相当无情的人物。

[在DK的教义（印度教和神学）框架内，萨纳特-库马拉是一个高级宇宙实体，就所有意图和目的而言，他是我们星球的上帝。他是我们所处的这个世界的主人。我将留给读者进一步研究这个话题，因为有各种观点。编者注]。
你是对的，由Lyricus秩序开发的作品是有编码的（正如我们以前讨论过的）；然而，它们不一定是以你应用的数字学等价物来编码的。我们并不假定这等同于对有抱负的学生的有效指导。更多的情况是，我们有编码信息的习惯，以达到谨慎的目的。当这个习惯形成得很好，工作也很重要时，就像支流区的情况一样，我们自然会用数字、符号、语言的底色、曼陀罗的节奏、色彩频率和音乐频率来编码信息。所有这些方面都交织成更深层次的意义，反映了宇宙学和多元宇宙的结构，将人类的意识与整体性的导航者联系起来。

2003年8月12日、1983年8月12日、1963年8月12日、1943年8月12日、1923年8月12日，等等，就时间旅行和地球生物节律而言，这些日子是否有任何意义？这些日期在《蒙托克计划》系列书籍中提到，是时间旅行的重要日期，例如费城实验。

不，BST不需要固定在地球上或人类的生物节律上。BST，甚至是较低形式的时间旅行，都不是门户、门路或维度排列的功能关系。它是一种技术的功能，适当地与人类操作员结合--在这种情况下。


Hakomi遗址有多少个房间？Hakomi遗址有室画吗？如果有的话，我们什么时候可以看到它们？

Hakomi网站由十七个腔调组成。[请注意，在WingMakers的网站上有二十一首Hakomi音乐曲目。编者按】。］音乐是所有七个网站中的一个一致性。艺术也在所有的网站中使用，但在符号的使用甚至风格上都略有不同。至于你什么时候能看到它们，你可能已经看到了，因为马克已经在WingMakers网站上发布了一些函授艺术，尽管我不能确定它在页面URL方面的位置。其他的将随着后续音乐CD的发行而跟进。


你是谁/什么人，詹姆斯？你从哪里得到你的信息？

在我主导的现实中，我被称为Mahu Nahi。我是一个教学组织的成员，这个组织的根基非常古老，但矛盾的是，它与人类的未来非常相关。这个教学组织关注的是将感官数据流传送到地球上，以便催化未来三代中被选中的个人，为科学、艺术和哲学领域带来创新。这些创新将使地球上的大门户得以发现和建立。
我可以被比喻为一个翻译，将已经存在的支流区以可理解的感官数据流的形式 "传送 "到地球。这个数据流将有明确的和隐含的内容，化身的灵魂将被调整来识别。这些材料将唤醒他们的发现蓝图，这些蓝图在受孕时被编码到他们的DNA中。

我的信息--因为它与WingMakers的材料有关--来自于这个教学组织所创建的七个支流区。我参与了这些支流区的设计，并因此被委托将它们翻译成适合人类神经解剖系统的数据流，这需要我化身为人类的身体。


你被称为Mahu Nahi。Mahu Nahi是你的精神的另一个化身，委托James（你现在的化身）为地球上的人翻译这些材料？
不，我在Lyricus的名字是Mahu Nahi。这是我的学生和伙伴们对我的称呼。实际上，Mahu Nahi是我的SECU人格的名字，而James是我此时的人类人格的名字。

你是一些人宣称的 "大师 "吗？

关于 "大师 "一词有很多定义，我不愿意说我是这样的，或者我不是这样的，除非有一个定义伴随着这个词。由于你的问题没有提供定义，我无法提供答案。然而，我将承认你问题的精神，那就是：我是什么？

在这方面，我和你们一样。我是一个多维的生命，同时生活在一系列的现实中。我的主导现实使我能够感知到这个现实的三维 "表面 "背后和之外。很可能和你或其他读者一样。

就我而言，作为这种能力的结果，我能够把来自我的主导现实的艺术、音乐、诗歌和哲学翻译成你们的。在这样做的过程中，我翻译了具有催化未来发现的潜力的感官数据，这将有助于重新定义人类的灵魂。

现在，这是否意味着我是一个大师？个人行为的产出总是与你内部期望的目标和你的同伴的产出相比较。这就是通常衡量我们的方式，不是吗？对于一个按照自己的目的运作的人来说，没有衡量或比较的标准。

在人类的舞台上，"大师 "比比皆是。有些人是优秀的教师，但很少有人教如何从人类思维主导的现实过渡到人类灵魂的现实。甚至更少的人教导如何过渡到主权整体状态的意识和功能。我可以告诉你一件事，不要相信任何人的宣称（包括我的），相反，要深入研究所谓大师的成果，并确定他们如何赋予你权力，使你成为自己的自足教师。如果你能发现这一点，那么你就找到了一个值得你花时间和精力的大师。

我在这里的措辞会很具体。我知道你是一个多维实体，同时存在于永恒中，在肉体中，在时间的化身中。这个问题是针对在此时此地回答这个问题的物理实体而言的。你是一个标准的人类，与这个时期地球上所有类别的人类在基因上是相同的，是由一个人类妇女所生的身体？或者，你是由 "他人 "放置在地球上的克隆人、混血儿、外星人等？

我出生时是个人类，父母都是人类。如果你在出生时检查我的DNA，你会发现与你自己的差异很小。区别的因素是，我的意识摆脱了以生存为基础的能量系统，该系统将人类限制在对其固有目的的非常名义上的实现。在我的意识中，有一种与我的目的和血统的联系，这种联系胜过几乎所有人类都要经历的灌输过程。正是这种对我的目的的认同，使我在很小的时候就回忆起我化身为人类的目的。

为什么对你的行踪和身份保密？我知道你希望材料优先于一个可能的 "弥赛亚 "人物。你是否担心中情局、联邦调查局、国家安全局、MJ12、军情六处、光照派、Bilderberg的什么人等会追踪你？

目前有几个团体知道我在地球上的存在。在大多数情况下，我的工作在他们看来只是增加了他们已经建立起来的错误信息程序。对大多数秘密组织来说，关于他们的报道越多，与以前持有的观念不同，就越好。正是这种分歧创造并延续了不确定性，搅动了阴暗面，使他们在公众的视线中保持适当的隐蔽性。
这对我来说是有目的的，因为对某些团体来说，找到我是相对容易的，如果他们选择，就会损害我的任务。因此，我分享了许多关于这些组织的真相，知道这些真相与既定的猜测有分歧，而且，具有讽刺意味的是，通过这种分歧，我得到了保护，因为WingMakers被认为是一个神话，不会披露确凿的证据。

因为我的联盟，不太可能有人会选择故意阻碍这项任务，因为这些团体对我的血统很看重，在某些方面，这也是唯一能约束他们的地方。关于Lyricus，人们知之甚少。它确实是更广泛的宇宙中最神秘的教学组织。它的能力不为人知，但人们理所当然地认为它是对这个组织的尊重。

至于我个人的匿名性，这是我做出的选择，目的是减少我对这个时代的个人的教学模式，而将我一生的工作导向选定的化身SECU的人群。这就要求我专注于将支流区的感官数据流移植到数字媒体平台上，供后人使用。


为什么你认为有必要让自己成为WM材料的创造者，而不是让这些材料首先呈现为来自未来的人类的创造，称为 "WingMakers"？

在这个问题上，我的态度一直很一致。我不是WingMakers材料的创造者；我是翻译者。这些材料在我化身为地球人之前就已经存在。我把原始内容转化为一种能引起人类感官和思想共鸣的形式（音乐、艺术、文字、符号）（因为缺乏更好的术语）。原始材料，其中只有一小部分被翻译并发表在互联网上，是由WingMakers的一个子集创造的，称为Lyricus（我的术语）。Lyricus老师将这些材料集合起来，并将它们输出到像地球这样的各种生命星球上。在适当的时候，一脉相承的老师化身为人，开始了将这些材料转化为 "人形 "的严格过程。我只是这个系列中第一个开始翻译过程的人。至于你的问题，我所说的教师世家确实在真正意义上代表了人类的未来。

你认为是类似于 "造翼者 "的东西激发了你创造这个神话，还是你只是感到孤独和有点无聊？

我并没有受到启发来创造WingMakers的神话；我是被委托来执行这项具体任务的。没有人需要灵感来执行他们作为一个生命形式的目的本身所要求的任务。此外，我没有创造一个神话；我把一个支流区转化为感官数据流，可以催化人类丘脑皮层系统，唤醒其与遗传心灵的内在联系。我把它称为神话，只是因为我必须凭良心说，这些材料并不完全是事实。另外，神话使读者能够暂停不相信，这是读者/观众感受到意义所需的想象力火花的一个开口。


每个人都必须了解自己，以摆脱一切形式的外部依赖。这并不是说一个人不应该信任他人或在友谊和社区的联盟中团结起来。这只是一个警告，相对真理在那些渴望控制的人手中不断变化，即使他们的动机可能是善意的，但这仍然是一种控制形式。当等级制度扣留信息时，相对真理的解释中心被定位为获取和维持权力，而不是发放源头平等的授权"。阅读上述段落，如果我们用 "詹姆斯 "代替 "等级制度"，你不觉得你现在扣留信息而不是发放源头平等的授权，实际上是在进行一种控制（尽管你可能是善意的）吗？另外，我们不时地看到材料出现 "转折"，这很容易等同于教学中提到的等级制度。"相对真理在那些渴望控制的人手中不断转移"。你是否也考虑过在WM受众和你自己之间建立起的相互依存关系方面，缓慢地提供信息的效果？

[请注意，这是 "等级制度 "一词按照Lyricus和WingMakers材料赋予它的含义来使用的一个例子。它不是在序言中描述的神学意义上使用的。提问者提到的摘录来自第二厅哲学 "存在的转变模式。P. 1" Ed.]
作为Lyricus的成员，我专注于将Lyricus的内容翻译成人类标准--在材料和技术方面都是如此。这需要大量的努力和时间。如果我有时间解释翻译过程，我想你会明白。材料是编码的，这是主要的区别。翻译这些内容与将西班牙语翻译成英语在各方面都是不同的。因此，时间是一个问题。更重要的是，材料的发布不是根据我的时间表，而是根据化身灵魂的网状结构，物种的集体特征振动，以及大门户的发现时间表。让所有材料都能被阅读的愿望在三四十年内都不会实现。这不是控制或操纵的结果，而是对一个精心设计并被证明是有效的计划的回应。


我注意到，在对新闻列表参与者的一些答复中，你似乎时间非常有限，但会在其他紧急事务之间回答问题，我想知道这些其他紧急事务可能是什么？

我的工作要求我与他人互动，因为这项任务比一个人的任务要大得多。有时这意味着我需要旅行，有时需要我接待旅行者。另外，由于原始材料的错综复杂，翻译过程非常耗时。它不像通道，我一张嘴，话就掉出来了。特别是在音乐和艺术的情况下，它需要大量的时间来协调翻译，并试图保持它们的原始形式，同时将它们转换为三维的艺术形式。就音乐而言，它要求我找到合适的人才并与之合作，因为与其他材料相比，这是一个更加合作的翻译。


我想知道你是否参加了WingMakers的论坛？如果不参加，你为什么不参加呢？你是否与这个新闻列表保持距离，以便不成为那些可能正在寻找的人的救世主？

我不参与任何论坛或地球上的组织，包括WingMakers LLC。[我在这里翻译和提供更高层次的经验学习回路，以帮助促进对大门户的发现。我唯一能说我隶属于的组织是Lyricus。我在地球上不是为了验证任何人的信仰体系，或宣布他或她是 "真道 "的入门者。我更愿意专注于我的使命，因为我知道现代生活有其分散注意力的方法。

你是否有其他的教诲渠道，你可能会花更多的时间而不是在论坛上？

我想提醒你们，这些不是 "我的教诲"。我不是在教什么。我是在翻译那些在人类审查和自我控制的 "雷达 "之下的材料，并与你体内被称为 "整体性导航者 "的那一部分产生共鸣。

你有Sarah de Rosnay和至少一个其他帮助者（照片中的女士）。这些人是如何成为你的门徒/学生/帮助者的？你是否打算在未来接纳更多的追随者？

莎拉和马克是唯一直接协助我工作运作的人。我有一群学生，我与他们在意识的许多维度上合作，我通过支流区与这些学生合作，被你们称为WingMakers的材料。
是的，我将使用WingMakers的材料作为我的教学媒介来招收新学生。我打算保持不为人知的个性，让支流区的感官数据流来完成我的大部分教学。

[这位女士的照片可以通过第一来源光盘上的各种隐藏链接找到，可以在WingMakers的网站上订购。编者按】。］


你在纽约有一个工作室。你是如何资助自己的，因为你所有的时间都被WingMakers的翻译工作占用了？我假设你有一个隐藏的有偿工作的生活？

我的生活非常简单，通过我不愿意透露的方式养活自己。

荣创会是如何向你展示自己，并对你的生命作出深刻的召唤的？

我是一个在地球诞生之前就已经存在的教学组织的成员。我意识到这似乎是一个不可能的现实，但它仍然是我的现实。这个教学秩序与地球上的神秘教学秩序是一致的。我所代表的教学秩序在你们的世界中并不为人所知，因为它选择了隐藏，直到大门户的发现过程被公开。
你可以把我的教学秩序称为Lyricus。这是一个最接近其母语中真实名称振动的名字。Lyricus与中央种族或WingMakers结盟，其绝大多数成员都来自中央种族。

在Lyricus内部，专业知识以七个学科为中心。这些学科包括遗传学、宇宙学、形而上学、感官数据流、心理凝聚力和文化进化等领域。[主权整体是第七个。 编者按】正如你所看到的，我们并不完全专注于哲学或精神教义。我们的中心目的是在三维的、有生命的星球上无可辩驳地发现类人的灵魂。

Lyricus可以被比作中央种族的耶稣会士或西藏僧侣，只是他们更强调综合科学和艺术的关系。尽管如此，他们是中央种族的一个派别，负责将宇宙中的类人种群引导到大门户，从而将整个物种灌输到更广泛的智能、相互联系的宇宙网络中。

这项任务需要一个非常广泛的议程，其核心包括遗传学，而上述其他六个学科是不可或缺的，但却是推动类人物种发现其自身生命力的外围力量--整体性导航仪。Lyricus采用各种感官数据流来唤醒一个物种，包括音乐、书籍、艺术、科学、文化和神话。一般来说，这些都是孤立的表达方式，但随着物种越来越接近大门户，感官数据流越来越多地被整合、编码，并代表了意识扩张的强大力量。

在地球上，有一个非物理教师的秩序，我们与他们协调我们的议程和基本目标。[这些老师对人类的状况很有经验，因此拥有同情心和同理心的关键要素，而我们--Lyricus--有时并不具备这些要素。他们在人类状况的背景下为我们的目标提供管理，并在困惑和迷惑人类的情感和精神冲突问题上为我们提供建议。

现在，回到你的问题上。我是一个编码感官数据流的老师，在我的要求下，我被训练成银河系支流区的人类翻译，使它们能被21世纪的人类理解。造翼者并没有向我揭示他们自己，就像人类同胞向你 "揭示 "他们一样。

也许宇宙中最大的秘密之一--与组织有关的--是Lyricus教学团。它是一个看不见的基石SOA，并且喜欢保持这种状态，直到大门户被发现。

如果它的身份被提前披露，它就会受到各方面力量的迅速和持续的攻击。(在Lyricus内部，我们把权力的四分之一称为政府、科学、宗教和文化。）我们从经验中知道这一点。因此，我们通过现有的结构工作，将我们的影响力放在每一个季度。无论如何，我不是唯一一个代表Lyricus的人，在这个时候体现在地球上。虽然我可能是文化权力区的核心，但我在其他三个区都有对应的人，他们同样没有声望和可见的存在，但却在悄悄地发展他们的任务，促进发现大门户所需的变化。

即使我们向地球介绍自己，也是在神话和故事的幌子下进行的。我们没有在事实的背景下宣称自己，因为这样我们肯定会被每个地区的权力机构所惧怕。在这种恐惧中，存在着一个物种在接近大门户时的自然张力。如果权力机构知道我们的目标是将大门户作为主权整体网络的一个节点，他们就会进行抵制[见词汇表。 编辑]。这种抵制会使实现这一突破性发现所需的资金和法律制定变得不可能。因此，Lyricus向每个季度派出催化剂，目的是建立一个 "无效区"，作为这些所需变革的孵化器和催化剂。

Lyricus是一个难以想象的大型SOA[源头组织结盟]，具有实质性的影响力和权威。它的 "主管 "是第一源泉的第七个原型。你可以把Lyricus看作是真理的保护者，而我们寻求保护的唯一的 "真理 "是给予一个类人物种通过自己的主动性发现大门户的可及性。我们在一个物种的层面上工作，而不是个人，尽管我们确实与个人合作，作为测试我们对物种知识的一种手段。在宗教领域的地球组织更倾向于与个人合作，所以可以理解的是，当有人听说Lyricus或WingMakers时，他们自然会断言DK[见Djwhal Khul.Ed.]没有透露我们的存在，这很奇怪，尤其是当我们的目标一致时。

如果，"Lyricus与中央种族或WingMakers结盟，其绝大多数成员都来自中央种族"，这是否来自这个太阳系内，如果是，是什么计划和地球？如果在这个系统之外，我们是否在谈论昴宿星团的区域？(如果是这样，那么 "中央种族 "是否与中央灵性太阳有任何关系？

[这个提问者正在寻求活跃智能的第三条射线与 "昴宿星团区域"（根据爱丽丝-A-贝利书籍的神秘宇宙学）和Lyricus之间的对应关系。注：有许多网站提供关于七条射线的信息。编者注]。
Lyricus首先是一个围绕着七个知识类别组织起来的教学兄弟会--每一个都是使一个物种能够将他们的顶级技术和知识定位在追求人类灵魂的无可辩驳的科学发现（被称为大门户）的过程的组成部分。这一发现，不同于个人的、内省的过程，是为整个物种设计的，因此，意味着更重要的努力和协调。

正是为了实现这一目标，中央精神太阳确实被调整，并作为一个放大系统来实现Lyricus的目标。Lyricus和中央精神太阳之间的主要关系相当于一艘帆船和它与风的关系。由于Lyricus是一个外向型的任务，中央太阳在传播Lyricus的教义方面起着一种能量化的作用--与其说是内容和原则的创造者，不如说是Lyricus教义在目标物种中的一种准备或预备因素。

虽然Lyricus在智力上与Hierarchy及其目标和目的相一致，但它也通过编码的声音和光线进行单独的教学，WingMakers是其中的一部分。

[在他的回答中，詹姆斯是根据神学模式使用 "等级制度 "一词的，如序言中所解释的。詹姆斯使用的是提问者最熟悉的词汇。在这种情况下，"层次 "是指地球上的SOA。见本节，源头组织调整（SOA）。编者注]。


在我们这一带，银河系，等等，WingMakers是否与任何其他人有交易？这就是为什么有其他的教义，如《乌兰图》，以及其他与WM哲学非常相似的通道材料？

被称为WingMakers的教义的输出实际上是由Lyricus集合起来的工作。WingMakers这个名字只是一个编码词，被用来代表这些教义对人类的一部分。就Lyricus的任务和范围而言，它和宇宙中的任何组织一样意义深远，而且它肯定对银河系中其他有生命的星球有影响。其他的教义，如乌兰图亚（Urantia）或通道教义，则来自不同的来源。在某些情况下有相似性，在这种程度上，这是因为宇宙不完全是主观的。

他们（造翼者）究竟是在这里化身留下神器，还是只是显现出来就离开？

Lyricus的代表化身为人类，而不是乘坐宇宙飞船或其他类型的交通工具前往有生命的星球。这样做是为了提高效率、隐蔽性，以及加深对如何将Lyricus教义融入本土文化的理解。这些人格在人类中大多是隐形的。当他们接近11岁生日时，他们通常会被另一个在他们之前的Lyricus成员激活，触发他们的意识。这些来自Lyricus的催化剂可能是实际存在的，或者是在梦境潜意识层面上的精神联系。不管是什么情况，这种激活是 "下载 "任务目标的原因，并触发了伴随着这些嵌入式Lyricus工人的不可侵犯的责任感。

当我第一次读到《曼图斯蒂亚的愿景》时，我认为这个存在可能是萨纳特-库马拉。曼图斯提亚是萨纳特-库马拉吗？如果不是，谁是曼图斯提亚？

曼图斯蒂亚是一位升天的大师，他是一个对地球具有行星意义的杰出实体；但是，它不是萨纳特-库马拉。在Lyricus教学团中，根据人格所采用的教学方法，人格之间有区别。
可以采用的方法很多，有某些教师找到了综合这些方法的方法，通过简单的语言交流就能在学生中引起启示性的经验。曼图斯蒂亚发展了许多最著名的利里库斯的论述。他是Lyricus内部最深奥秩序的大师级人物，在人类基因组中开发出论述、教学方法和体验式学习环境。你将能够认出他的声音，因为它有一种不可思议的能力，能够将矛盾与真理融合在权威的小调中。如果以其纯正的母语来听，曼图斯蒂亚的声音和智慧是无可比拟的。

造翼者是否类似于一些文献中提到的玛那萨普特拉或大建造者？

["Manasaputras "这个名字是梵语，一般是指 "心灵之子"。这些人是宇宙生命的高级秩序，是世界的建设者。编者注]。
造形者（我指的是他们）并不是造翼者。把造翼者看作是一个集体身份，类似于我们对 "人类 "的称呼，只不过造翼者代表第七个宇宙中心种族。他们是第一源的第七个原型的 "孩子"，而人类是造翼者的 "孩子"。

在造翼者内部，就像在人类内部一样，存在着巨大的多样性。换句话说，不是每个身为第七宇宙中心种族的人都关心人类的精神福利。因此，在非常、非常古老的时代（就人类对这些事情的看法而言），开发了一种教学资源，称为Lyricus（它的真实名称无法在地球的口语中披露）。

Lyricus本身就是地球上奥秘/事件/神秘学派中的一缕神话般的烟雾。我不被允许透露关于这个组织的更多信息，所以它迫使我在问题上 "跳舞"。形体制造者是Lyricus的使者，但他们与WingMakers明显不同，他们存在的功能是被输出到发展中的、有生命的星球上，并作为类人生命形式的遗传祖先。

在Lyricus内部有七个主要的知识学科。最中心和统一的学科是遗传学。形状建造者是这一学科的一部分，但他们更关心的是物种在其发展的形成阶段，而当它接近发现大门户的顶点机会时，就不那么关心了。形式构建者是Lyricus的创造物。

你听说过 "循环中的循环 "或轮中之轮的说法。在这里，它表现为每个有生命的星系都有一个人形原型，就像七个宇宙中的每一个都有一个一样，而在一个星系的每个部门（通常分为大约一千个部门）都有一个基于星系模型的子原型。这个子原型就是奥秘学派中所说的形式构建者。

这是第一源泉的一个美丽的讽刺，形式建设者，尽管他们的身份神秘而隐蔽，但实际上以他们的身体、思想和精神整合的形式存在于每个活生生的人类之中。形式构建者是Lyricus内部一个非常广泛的组织的一部分，你可以把它看作是一个庞大的遗传学家的科学机构，但不是地球上的那种。形式构建者不研究遗传学，他们创造遗传学；他们不揭示他们的创造物，他们就是他们的创造物。

AAB材料和WMM之间最强大的桥梁是Lyricus教学令，但Lyricus的教义还需要一些时间才能带到人间。尽管如此，当这些教义发布时，它们将支持许多许多学生从旧的灵性世界观迁移到新的世界观的重量。

[下面的图直接取自詹姆斯对这个问题的回答，涉及到玛那萨普特拉或詹姆斯所说的 "形式建造者"。］

尽管你来自一个遥远的星系，但你是以天狼星系为基地的利里库斯教团的一员，这样说是否公平？

这是一个很难回答的问题，至少是用语言来回答。它要求你重新组织你对实体的定义。你的问题暗示，我不能同时在多个系统中运作。我知道你知道在兄弟会[地球上的教师等级制度。 编者注]中，有一些人实行双重定位。虽然这通常是在肉体的背景下考虑的，但在更高的身体中的多重定位不仅是可能的，而且对Lyricus的成员来说也是必要的。时间不允许我列举其中的原因，但最重要的原因是非常直观的：多重定位使我们能够将我们的振动知识 "传播 "给更多人。

采取什么程序来决定每份材料的公开发布日期？例如，你是否有一个清单，上面写着，例如，2008年2月20日，第23期哲学被发布？

评估的依据是我现在不能透露的因素。有一个一般的 发布时间表，但它没有具体到一天或甚至一周和一个月。它在一定程度上是由外部事件触发的。

"他们 "是通过什么方式来跟踪我们吸收材料的进展的？他们现在在哪里？

没有人可以 "跟踪 "个人在吸收Lyricus教义方面的进展。每个人都会发出或传播一种标志性的振动。这种振动被集体编织成一个物种。正是这种振动被Lyricus "读取"，根据这种集体特征，可以大致了解该物种的进展情况。

在我们准备好接受更多类别的揭示之前，我们可以预期感受到哪些变化？

我不确定你说的 "类别 "是什么意思。我将假设你是指Lyricus的七个学科。物种的标志性振动决定了这一派别的时间--从外部来说。
