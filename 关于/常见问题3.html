The Plan that the Hierarchy seeks to implement is subject to modifications continually. What are its five top major priorities today?
 
Priorities are not assessed numerically. In other words, there is a fundamental purpose within the Hierarchy and hundreds of related tactics. Some tactics may have more near term importance than others, and to this extent, there is a sense of priority, but everything is part of a single, evolutionary system that positions the human species and proof of soul on a collision course.
Every evolutionary system is designed to ultimately transform into an innovative system with a new, but related purpose. Evolutionary systems have a distinctive culmination that is the catalyst that enables the transformation to occur. In the case of humanity’s present evolutionary system, the discovery of the Grand Portal is the distinctive culmination, and when it occurs, it will shift the evolutionary system from a human species/planetary focus to an interdimensional species/intergalactic focus based on humanity’s ability to use the Grand Portal as an interface to the Sovereign Integral Network.
 
The responsible application of the Grand Portal will fall to the disciples of the Sacred Path to faithfully execute. All of the training, preparation, and sacrifice of today is designed to enable the disciples of the future to responsibly manage and protect the findings of the Grand Portal. This is the focal point of the Hierarchy, though not all within the Hierarchy are aware of this overarching goal and its culmination, which is anticipated in the latter quarter of the twenty-first century.
 
It is my understanding that humanity as a whole, as well as the very planet itself and all forms of life upon it, are undergoing vast biological changes at the most fundamental levels. There are those of us who are aware of this consciously, i.e. having made the decision to embody the energy of our Soul, Wholeness Navigator, etc. Many of us began this process over a decade ago and continue to experience excruciating pain and discomfort in the physical body, as well as fits of depression and mental and emotional challenges. Some refer to this as transformation, ascension, clearing ancestral karma, etc. This is of concern to so many; could you please comment on this? For instance, what is really happening, and what can we expect as the awakening process continues and/or concludes?
 
Thank you for your question and interest in this topic.
It is true that the human instrument, in some cases, is undergoing changes, and that these changes can be experienced, sometimes with intensity, and sometimes with remarkable subtlety. However, the more profound changes—those dealing with the fundamental structure of the human instrument—do not necessarily manifest as physical discomforts or emotional depression.
 
Very often physical discomforts and emotional turbulence are attributable to a myriad of unrelated causes, which, I’m sure you’ll agree, are unconnected to this fundamental evolution of the human instrument. Each must use their discernment and self-knowledge to differentiate the effects of the weather, diet, conditions of stress, etc. from those more fundamental changes that are occurring at the atomic or sub-atomic levels.
 
The human instrument is a composite structure. It is not merely physical. It includes the pathways of the mind and emotional intellect that are intertwined more intimately with the Wholeness Navigator than is the physical body. It is the Wholeness Navigator that is expressing its form of consciousness through the human instrument more vividly, and this expression energizes the pathways that connect, or “bridge” the mind and emotional consciousness with the Wholeness Navigator.
 
You can think of these pathways as a root system. The mind and emotions are like the roots of the physical body, drawing nutrients from the Wholeness Navigator. If the Wholeness Navigator is activated to express itself more vividly in the physical, three-dimensional world, its nutritional supply is intensified and the mind and emotions will undoubtedly absorb this intensification and pass it along to the physical body.
 
The presence of the Wholeness Navigator is invisible to the human instrument, and, for the most part, is not felt directly. The higher pathways of the mind imagine it, and these images are translated to the emotions and body through music as vividly as any art form. Every person reacts a little differently to these translations; there is no standard reaction.
 
The important thing to understand is that the presence of the Wholeness Navigator is pressing into the physical dimension and leaving its indelible effect. There are many reasons why this is occurring, but the most notable is that the individuals incarnating at this time are consciously, and in some cases, subconsciously, calling forth the Wholeness Navigator consciousness to radiate its unification energy to the human instrument.
 
I realize that this may not be the conscious plea or prayer, but it is the hidden form of the communiqué, and when this is done, the Wholeness Navigator intensifies its vibrational resonance. The human instrument begins to activate, or change, as a result. This change is very fundamental and is generally felt as a growing sensitivity to stress, which, in the physical body, can manifest as headaches and body aches, numbness in the limbs, and rapid energy surges and depletions.
 
The physical reasons for this have to do with the tenth chromosome and how it regulates the stress-coping capabilities of the body, mind, and emotions. The Wholeness Navigator is called forth by the human instrument, and the human instrument is activated by the intensification of the Wholeness Navigator. The activation of the human instrument causes profound changes to the DNA structure, brain chemistry, and the central nervous system.
 
This activation is a natural evolution of the human instrument. It arises from the desire to feel unified and whole, which is precisely what the human instrument was designed to obstruct. Remember that the human instrument is what enables the Wholeness Navigator to experience separation and individuated experience within the realm of time and space. Thus, if it is to embody the unification vibration, it must transform.
 
This transformation is not occurring as broadly as your question implies. It is limited to the human instrument of a small percentage of the overall human population. I am aware that there are reports alleging that the earth, as a whole, is undergoing nothing short of a global transmutation, but it is not the case. Transformation occurs one individual at a time, at the request of the individual. It is not orchestrated for all life forms simultaneously because this would require a cessation of free will.
 
As more and more individuals call forth the Wholeness Navigator, and subsequently alter the function of their human instrument, it becomes easier for new generations of humans to embody the unification vibration within their human instrument. This is all part of the divine blueprint for the evolution of the human species as a soul carrier capable of cosmological exploration.
 
I hope this explanation, while brief and admittedly abstract, is helpful to your understanding. As with any subject of this magnitude, I could write a hundred pages and only scratch the surface of the topic. Having written only a few pages, you can imagine how inadequate this rendering is. However, time doesn’t permit me to provide you with all the details.
 
It gives me relief to hear that you explain two forms of dominant models of existence that shape the interaction and destiny of the human race—the Evolution/Saviorship model and the Transformation/Mastership model. You say it is a challenge of the individual to recognize these two dominant models of existence and integrate them in order to design the synthesis model. Can you describe this synthesis model and how it might look like to humankind in general?
 
The synthesis model is anchored first in the knowledge of who you are at a fundamental level. This requires you to understand and, to the degree possible, experience the individuated consciousness as your multi-faceted identity. When the Grand Portal is discovered, the individuated consciousness will be—in effect—dissected and made visible for the first time; similar in some ways to when the human body was first dissected and its internal organs were named and their purpose identified.
This is the dawning of the synthesis model of existence for humanity in general. Its chief feature, in terms of being visible to the general public, is the sense of validation it brings to the belief systems of immortality and human interconnectedness. On most planets undergoing this process, the synthesis model of existence dawns at the discovery and propagation phases of the Grand Portal. It has a radical and desirable effect on institutional integrity—that is to say, any institution that has been based on the previous models of existence, atrophies and either adjusts its organizational rules, or it self-terminates. [See Models of Existence in glossary. Ed.]
 
What is the best and most accessible way to obtain and experience higher powers, or the ‘super’ human state of mind. By this I refer to anything like majick, excelled intelligence and the likes—I think you get my gist.
 
I’m asked this question (or variations of it) more often than any other, and my answer is inevitably the same: align your personal objectives with the universal objectives. In other words, if you focus your efforts on finding the sensory data streams that resonate with your consciousness and lead to your self-mastery, these same data streams will illuminate the universal objectives as they pertain to the species of which you are a part and the planet upon which your species exists. Once this is realized—even dimly—you can align your personal path with the universal. When this is done, you accelerate at the rate that is optimal for your consciousness, while remaining in balance.
Focus on alignment to that which resonates with your core instinctual sense of the universal objectives. I have made the bold assertion that the discovery of the human soul in the irrefutable laboratories of human science is the next phase of the universal objective as it pertains to the human species and planet earth. If this resonates with your core sense of purpose, then align to it. This will accelerate, amplify, and catalyze the blueprint of your Sovereign Integral state of consciousness.
 
Anxiety of Ignorance [This answer relates to the circumstances of many spiritual students who feel that they are no longer fully engaged with the everyday world, and yet, at the same time, feel that they are not fully present in the world of spirit. Psychologically, they feel that they are between two worlds. See 32-S3. Ed.]
 
As for your question, the human instrument is a complex and intricate vessel of which you, like all humans of this era, have a small degree of understanding (despite modern science).
 
The human instrument is operating on multiple levels, multiple dimensions of time-space, and is extremely sensitive to psychic energy. It is not a function of being between worlds; it is the anxiety of ignorance. It is entirely natural to be anxious about one’s ignorance. All humans to varying degree have this anxiety. It is not reserved for those on the path of self-enlightenment; despite that fact it is articulated in the vocabulary of “dark night of soul,” “the perceptual lag of spiritualization” or “self-initiatory defeatism” that have become—what my associates refer to as—the complaining vocabulary of initiates.
 
You relate your experience in a humorous way (in your letter). I commend your sense of humor. It certainly brought a smile to my face. Humor is an excellent weapon against the anxiety of ignorance. Just remember, in the hopes it makes you feel better, you are in very good company.
 
Anxiety of ignorance is as omnipresent as the human instrument itself, and its prevalence is due to the reality of the human instrument’s inability to “know itself” through the mind. It can only know itself through the Wholeness Navigator, but paradoxically, this knowing is not in the format that is acceptable to the human instrument.
 
Is it possible in your next release to give plans, diagrams, circuits, and components that will facilitate a direct link to the WingMakers after the manner of an RV set that the ACIO uses.
 
I’m afraid not. If you want to communicate with the WingMakers, you simply need to apply the techniques in the Chamber Four philosophy paper and apply the principles outlined in the Chamber One philosophy. These two papers are very powerful elements for attuning to the frequency of the WingMakers. It is not that you will communicate with words, but rather you will enjoy the unmistakable presence of their consciousness. This alone is a key approach to aligning yourself to the universal objectives.
The WingMakers do the majority of their communication during the dream state because the gates of the thalamocortical system are relatively closed, and there is complete focus on the inner communication at hand. If you have willingly immersed yourself in the WingMakers’ materials, you can safely assume that you are already in rapport with members of this teaching organization. You are very likely experiencing the Tributary Zones during your dream state, under the tutelage of one or more of these teachers. Open yourself to this possibility and dream it alive to your senses.
 
Since so much of the WingMakers’ material seems destined for future generations, is there much reason for present-day generations (e.g., the elderly) to read or study the material?
 
If any material resonates as truth in your innermost mind and heart, allow it entry. Once internalized, allow it to exit freely. If it stays around, you have found a valuable asset to your evolving belief system. If it leaves or goes into hibernation, it simply means you have reason to continue your search.
This applies equally to the WingMakers’ material. It is not intended to be an exclusive collection of sensory data streams—quite the opposite. There are entities incarnated now who will be returning in human embodiment in the next one hundred years who will play a significant role in the unveiling and dissemination of the Grand Portal. Their involvement with these materials now will help them navigate to these roles because it will recalibrate their internal value system, and in some instances, literally recast their destinies.
 
Moreover, while the actual discovery of the Grand Portal may ultimately be credited to a handful of individuals, it will be the achievement of millions of entities that grafted their intellects, actions, and inspirational ideas together to build the ultimate mosaic of the human spirit. Anyone involved in these works will be a part of this mosaic. [See also: Significance of the Grand Portal Discovery. Ed.]
 
 
What percentage of humanity does the Hierarchy regard as a) Currently undergoing the first initiation. b) Have already taken it?
 
The “roof” of desire, in any divinely oriented initiate on the Sacred Path, does not consist of degrees or even the hard-earned achievements they represent. It consists of the contribution of their soul to the expansion of the evolutionary conditions of their respective species. It is for this reason that initiations are not particularly important in the eyes of the hierarchy, nor are they seen as badges of honor or credentials of higher purpose.
That said, I understand the nature of your question, and I will give you some general guidelines. There are slightly fewer than one hundred thousand initiates who are presently incarnated upon earth who are following the Wisdom Path loosely established by the Hierarchy. That is to say, they are following the principles as set forth by the masters and practicing these principles in their day-to-day life. Not impeccably, but with the human qualities of inconsistency.
 
 
Is there an initiation required for students to learn the esoteric ways of the ascended masters?
 
I am one of the teachers who have some degree of intolerance towards concepts like light quotient, ascension schedules, initiations, ascension seats, etc. These concepts are of the old Tributary Zones, and they are continued by those who are prisms of these Tributary Zones who have become indoctrinated by the teacher-student ordering of the old hierarchy. This particular student was one who was impregnated by these concepts at an early age and couldn’t quite let go of them.
When a student of this mindset meets a teacher like myself, it can often be unsettling for them because I will rip apart the indoctrination like someone who unwraps a mummy, exposing its frail skin to the sunlight. If the student survives this, they will look upon their role differently. They will walk a sovereign path built on their own inner wisdom, and it may not have a thing to do with the Hierarchy or ashramic work or this ray or that ray. [James is referring to the seven rays, as found in the Theosophical and Alice Bailey/Djwhal Khul (DK) philosophies. Ed.] It will be about the entity’s expression in real-time, and how that expression is resonating with those whom its life is intricately connected. It is about living the Life Principles of the Sovereign Integral.
 
Returning to this individual, he came to me one day and announced his plans to leave. He had felt a need for some time to return to his indoctrination (my words, not his), and like the prodigal son, return to his master. He felt that I was not carrying on the tradition of being a master who teaches knowledge by words and deeds, that I was too enamored by teaching through art, music, psychology, etc. To him, he needed a teacher who could tell him what to do, where to go, how to get there, and who to be once he arrived.
 
 
I realize that you are not much into initiation levels, but simply as a point of reference, the above description reminds me of that point between the second and third initiations, which DK refers to as probably the most difficult stage of human evolution, (on earth at least). The disciple/student is in a kind of psychological no man’s land, walking between two worlds. Do you see it that way?
 
There are reasons that I am not an advocate of initiation levels. It presumes a process can be imposed on or applied to the human instrument that is predictive of a prescribed outcome. However, the initiate who is asked to faithfully experience this process is not adequately developed in their awareness to know who is doing the “prescribing” or what is the outcome as it pertains to them as an individual. They are therefore practicing blind faith to an invisible “prescriber”—a condition that entrains the human instrument to a course of gradual awakening and over-reliance to uniform process.
 
 
What are the major liabilities of disciples today, as regarded by the Hierarchy? Are they the same as they used to be, for example, liabilities such as lack of sensitivity to impression, inertia, fear, materialistic etc.?
 
Here again, the Hierarchy is not unanimous. From the point of view of Lyricus, whose perspective I know best, there are three major liabilities in the disciples of today:
1. They operate in CoD (Caves of Disconnection), which undermines the spirit of collaboration and sharing that is required to refresh and revitalize the teachings. The cave metaphor is also relevant to this issue because the natural tendency of the disciple is to keep the esoteric teachings esoteric. This applies not only to the Wisdom Path of the White Lodge, but also to the related fields of genetics, particle physics, sound and light theory, cosmology, the new psychology, and so on. Disciples need to educate themselves in all these areas because they are all related to what beckons humanity.
 
2. The teachings of the Sacred Path are neither rigid nor complete. Disciples must retain their flexibility and willingness not only to evolve the contemporary teachings into new territories of expression, but also to look for how the teachings can be synthesized or hybridized with new teachings that are arising. Disciples have the liability of being locked into the traditional paradigms and protecting their intellectual appeal for the sake of ego and the familiarity of comfort.
 
3.The esoteric is very hard to make exoteric unless it clearly demonstrates an ethical nature that is manifest in the disciple’s life. In other words, the consistency of right relations and the will-to-good is expressed faithfully across the life stream of the individual. This requires an exceptionally disciplined approach to one’s communication, and I use the term communication in its broadest meaning.
4.
What are the major areas that world disciples could be concentrating their focus on, to expedite the work of the Hierarchy?
 
There is nothing to concentrate on, other than to overcome the liabilities briefly mentioned above. I understand the nature of your question, but the Hierarchy does not require the conscious and deliberate group focus of disciples to carry out or expedite its mission.
 
Is there an initiation required for students to learn the esoteric ways of the ascended masters? (Continued from Initiation 39-S3A. Ed.)
 
…I bid him farewell, explaining my resolution to create tools and not to instruct in what I refer to as the Minutiae of the Esoteric (MOTE). But for this student, this was what he needed. The minutiae of the esoteric was the scaffolding that supported his need for that elixir of elitism called arcane knowledge.
Experience of the Wholeness Navigator is not in any way related to MOTE, and this experience is what I teach. The problem with experiencing the Wholeness Navigator is that for some students they find themselves unable to become teachers themselves, and this is why most students or initiatives arrive to my door. They desire to be teachers of MOTE, though they masquerade as students of spirit.
 
Why? Because as a teacher of MOTE they suddenly belong to the Hierarchy, hoping to launch themselves like an ascending rocket to the heavens where all things are possible. The lurking, subconscious equation: Mastery of MOTE + Ascended Master + Initiation Process = Control. Thus, when a student comes to me, I scrutinize their intentions, filtering the authentic desire for experience of the Wholeness Navigator from the indoctrination artifacts that create a leaning towards MOTE.
 
Control is the indoctrination artifact that leads many a student to my door, though they generally are not aware of it. I would ask you to ponder this. Examine your intentions, and see if you desire experience or knowledge. They are not mutually exclusive, if experience of the Wholeness Navigator is prized above control; and if the expression of the Wholeness Navigator is honored above the acquisition of MOTE.
 
I will return momentarily to the scenario I mentioned earlier in this letter. If you are a prism of a contemporary Tributary Zone of resonance to your heart and mind, and that part of you, referred to as the Wholeness Navigator, arises as your teacher, you will see that you are not a concretized prism of a particular shape, but that you can shape-shift to any geometric shape desired.
 
This is the beauty of experiencing the Wholeness Navigator and expressing its innate abilities. You are not protecting or professing MOTE; you are not an initiate desirous of teaching and control; you are not parroting the words of your master; rather, you are transparently transforming contemporary Tributary Zones to the dispersed masses of humankind who are seeking a new direction that is illumined by the tools of art and personal experience that have been decelerated to their particular needs.
 
In closing, I want you to know that I am not impugning the value of the ashramic missions as I know them, but rather, as you know them. You know them through the words of prisms not yet aware of their Wholeness Navigator. You know them through the MOTE that other initiatives have expressed from obsolete Tributary Zones. There is much less division and specialization within the Hierarchy than is acknowledged. The masters are not interested in MOTE… the initiates are.
 
The Tibetan tells us that our Sun is the heart centre of our local OAWNMBS (One About Whom Naught May Be Said). Is this the heart centre of the Sirian system?
 
I’m aware there is significant speculation about this matter within a group of disciples. Please understand that from the perspective of Lyricus, it seems odd that it would be a matter of speculation by any disciple, unless of course they are complete in their understanding of the anatomy of their individuated consciousness. And this, in my experience, is very seldom, if ever, the case.
Know thy self before the world, is an ancient edict, and the vagaries of the external cosmos, while interesting to know from a curiosity perspective, are not particularly relevant when compared to understanding one’s personal universe.
 
The simple answer to your question is: no. However, instead of elaborating on your question, I choose to focus on the issue of the Minutia of the Esoteric (MOTE). MOTE creates a telescoping complexity, and as long as the foundation of one’s personal universe is clear and well understood, this complexity can be integrated and useful. On the other hand, if the personal universe is faintly understood, then MOTE will serve another purpose altogether.
 
It is not a coincidence that Lyricus refers to this condition of external inquiry and speculation as MOTE. A moat [MOTE] around a castle is a form of protection and fortification. Think of your personal universe as a metaphor for a castle, MOTE as the moat, and the cosmos, or external universe as the potential enemy for whom your moat [MOTE] is designed to repel. If you construct a moat [MOTE] you only do so if you believe the external will invade the internal and somehow weaken, diminish or even destroy it.
 
In the sequencing of creation, the internal begets the external and thus, no mote is required, unless of course, the creator is unsure of their creation. This is the key element to ponder.
 
I know there are those who will tell you that the universe is composed of an absolute and objective reality. After all, it is accurate that the sun is the center of the solar system for all who dwell upon earth. And while there are fixed rules about geography and spatial relationships, little else can be “nailed down” quite so definitely, even in the physical world the densest of the assembled fields of vibration we call the multiverse.
 
However, as one casts their view beyond the MEST dimension (MEST—matter, energy, space, and time), they awaken to the realization that these super dimensions offer a subjective component that is acutely personal, malleable, and responsive. These fields of vibration support the primal impulse of the individuated and immortal consciousness that defines its reality in all worlds of its expression, including the MEST dimension. If not for the perceptual lag that MEST density necessitates, this creative flow would be clearly visible.
 
There is, as you know, a psychological condition sometimes referred to as consensus reality. If five thousand disciples of the Sacred Path said that Sirius’ heart center was our sun, and only five said it was not, consensus reality dictates the five contrarians are wrong or misguided.
 
I ask you a simple question: why would any teacher care to dictate or even weigh in on the consensus realities of MEST when MEST is simply a distant echo or artifact of the more vibrant worlds within the individual?
 
It is an observation of mine that the condition of MOTE is partly an outcome of the Hierarchy’s sequencing and emphasis of its dispensation of knowledge, and partly a product of how integral the personal and cosmic realms truly are.
 
These two realms are like conjoined twins with different personalities, minds, and temperaments, yet forced to walk as a single body. The body becomes the fixture of compromise, the garment of disorder. There is certain chaos, or disorder in the conjoined worlds because like competing gravitational fields, they pull you in different directions.
 
Within Lyricus we have a phrase: What is within is without equal, and it arises from the smallest space where the First Vibration of the Unmanifest surges in the splendor of One World’s Grace. Here you are the Creator-Perceiver as well as the Perceiver-Creator, the one who determines fate and destiny. This you can control. This you can embody for all ages.
 
What is within the MEST worlds, you can only give your energy and time to the transitory realities of the many or the few.
 
I am aware that I am being abstruse, and somewhat indifferent to your original question, but if you look carefully, you’ll see your answer—not so much in the literal text, but in the consciousness behind the words.
 
Is the Sirian system the solar plexus centre of the being who has the Great Bear as his head centre?
 
Again, I understand and appreciate your desire to comprehend these matters, but at the risk of redundancy, how will anything I say—relevant to your question—assist you in your deeper understanding of the One Whom Ought Be Inwardly Known (you). If you allow yourself to be pulled in these directions then prepare yourself to be disappointed by the deorbiting forces that pull you into MOTE in defense of your ignorance of OWOBIK.
The desire for the knowledge of MOTE is largely a function of ego. There are many highly developed spiritual teachers with initiations in excess of the seventh level that cannot tell you fundamental answers to questions of MOTE. This is because consensus realities—the realities of the many in MEST—do not have relevance in their teachings. I know a teacher who is gifted in the matters of the heart chakra at its most esoteric levels, but if you asked him a question like what is the relationship of S3 (sacred sound symbols) to the 268 cellular meridian lines in the palette and the hypothalamus, he would shrug his shoulders. He would desire to know the answer, but only because it is potentially related to his area of specialization, since the energy system of the individuated consciousness is holistic and unified.
 
However, if the question posed was of a cosmic order, as in your first question, he may know the answer, but would likely turn your attention to the personal level, reminding you—as I have—that before your field of inquiry expands to the cosmos, understand first what you are composed of, what you are, what your relationships are to First Source, what your service/dharma is, what you project into your personal universe and why.
 
“text-indent:2.3em;”>From my experience, the finest teachers turn the inquiry of cosmic MOTE to the fundamental understanding of OWOBIK first, the esoteric understanding of OWOBIK second, the relationship of OWOBIK to its origins and destiny [third], the relationship of OWOBIK to the cosmic plan [fourth], and finally the specialization path upon which the individual will bring forward their gifts of spirit [fifth]. Each stage of this sequence is not hermetically sealed from the others. The walls between them are porous, but nonetheless the teacher maintains the area of focus in the various stages.
 
Please understand that if I were in your presence I could ask you ten questions about the human ear-brain complex and you would fail me ten times; not because this information isn’t available at your local library or bookstore, but because you have not studied it. This, I assure you, is more important to understand than the cosmological order of distant solar systems.
 
Does my answer mean that the disciple should never make inquiries of cosmic MOTE? No. There is nothing wrong with this line of inquiry so long as you understand that it has implications and that you approach it aware of its innate shortcomings. Are there exceptions to this rule? Yes, there always are.
 
I have seen students who have an inborn gift for cosmic MOTE and it is an essential component of their dharma’s specialization. These individuals tend to be enamored of cosmic MOTE, trying their best to articulate and validate what they intuitively sense, which are typically artifacts of other lives or portals of consciousness that are subliminal to their conscious perception. These students are like detectives in search of hidden light switches in a darkened room.
 
The belief—subliminal as it may be—is that if they can throw the light switches to the “on” position, their enlightenment is assured; their karma is cleared and they are suitably in control of their destiny. The reality is that the darkened room is not cosmic, it is personal, and the darkness is the motive force that awakens the “Detective” to know thy self. The cosmic MOTE is a primary distraction along the way.
 
What is exciting and worthy of your energy—as it pertains to the cosmic—is the pre-form and pre-cognitive aspect: the unity behind the polarity. The multiverse is the ultimate open system, always self-correcting and seeking the dynamic equilibrium of its seed vibration. The individual is a particle of this macro-system, vibrating in resonance. In the individual’s deepest core it already understands what is necessary to know about the cosmos, and it is in a developmental, evolutionary state of mimicking the pre-formative aspect of the multiverse.
 
As we read previously, the Wholeness Navigator is the fragment of First Source with all its inherent capabilities. As such it has the potential to all knowledge on demand. Why should there be any need for the W.N. to “educate” itself in the non-physical tributary zone chambers and also be dependent on them? Hasn’t it been said that everything one needs is already contained within the Self? “Sovereignty allows that the source of liberating information is contained within the Self, and all that is needed to create new realities is also contained within the Self. Each individual must know them self to be free of all forms of external reliance.”
 
You have given voice to a question that lurks subconsciously in almost every student of the esoteric. If all knowledge is within the self, why does the student require instruction?
The key word in your question is “potential.” Yes, the human instrument is inherently connected to First Source through Source Intelligence. And yes, this connection provides access to infinite and dynamic knowledge, however, this point of access, or portal is not a simple thing to consciously attune to, nor is it “on-demand” at the discretion of the individual. Contact with Source Intelligence is a transformative experience and can have the unintended consequence of unbalancing an individual who is not properly prepared for the transmission.
 
Stepping down the vibration of sound and light, and making it more accessible to students is what Lyricus is primarily concerned with. Lyricus does not recommend that anyone become dependent on any external teacher or material. To do so implies stagnancy and devolution relative to one’s potential learning path. The WingMakers’ Materials are designed to catalyze specific receptors within the individuated consciousness and create a resonance. Through this resonance, the individual will “click into” their own awakening—revelation—transformation, and through this process they can more effectively wean themselves from external instruction and dependence.
 
 
Are the people on the discussion forum in any danger from any organisations because of our involvement with these materials?
 
No.
 
 
Does the discussion forum play a part in the event strings that will lead to the unveiling of the WingMakers?
 
Not in a direct manner at present, but there will be a time when the discussion forums will become more of a factor in enabling the incoming SECUs to coordinate their ideologies and vision.
 
Why do some individuals become unattached to spiritual organizations? I feel like I should be part of a church or religious institution and establish my true place, but there’s a part of me that feels my existential approach is necessary for my growth.
 
Informed entities are non-aligned for a good reason. They desire to be facile and fluent in their evolution of thought and in their absorption of new energies. This is noble. It is not something to be restless of, or disrespectful to. Rather, it is a sign that you honor the mobility of your consciousness more than its indoctrination.
Your “true place” is not a place, position, port, or location at all, but rather a projection of the attitude, or outlook of the Sovereign Integral consciousness. Let me explain it this way. Imagine the following scenario: a light beam, a prism, and seven individual rays from out of this spectrum cast upon a wall. Imagine yourself looking down on this scenario. There are four recognizable components, are there not?
 
1. The beam of light
 
2. The prism
 
3. The spectrum of seven rays
 
4. The wall
 
Now, let’s examine the scenario more in-depth. The wall is constructed of materials, thus the wall can be reduced to its component parts (stone, concrete, mortar, bricks, etc.). The spectrum, as we all know, represents millions of colors, though there are only seven that our eye-brain may immediately recognize. The beam of light has an origin, a wavelength, and a destination. Thus, everything has a multiplicity, but the prism.
 
The prism remains singular and sovereign. It is the catalytic force, in part, because of this singularity. Informed entities in this time, are transforming into catalysts or “prisms,” and the Tributary Zones can be likened to the beam of light. You may begin to see yourself as this prism that projects the beam of light from a Tributary Zone against the wall of your choosing. As a prism, you are no longer concerned about what ray you are affiliated with, nor the location of where that ray lands upon the wall. [Here, James is referring to the theory of the seven rays found in Theosophy and the Alice Bailey/DK philosophy. Ed.]
 
Let’s move to a new point of inquiry in this scenario. What is a prism? A prism is a transparent optic that is shaped to bend (transform) light. Since the refractive index of a material varies with wavelength, prisms are useful for dispersing different wavelengths of light. When light enters a solid material from air, the speed at which the light travels decreases. The light is decelerated, or stepped-down. If the light enters at an off-normal angle, the direction of the light changes. The light is refracted to a new path and can illumine therein.
 
Consider this scenario as it applies to your “place.” Note the italicized words and how they transfer to your own definitions of mission and purpose. Note also that prisms can be fashioned into a wide variety of geometric shapes, and that there can be anti-prisms as well. A triangular, equilateral (60° angle) prism disperses and decelerates light differently than a hexahedral prism.
 
If informed entities can be likened to prisms, then the only questions left remaining are the following:
 
• What light beam do I disperse and decelerate (make intelligible)?
 
• Upon what wall do I disperse the spectrum?
 
• Where do I position myself to optimally process the light beam?
 
• What kind and shape of prism do I choose to be?
 
Do you see how your question has been shifted or restructured? In effect, I have been a prism for your question. Now that your question has been dispersed to a new wall, it can be seen in a new light. In this new light, it is no longer about affiliations or alignment or ports of call. It is about four answers that are akin to choice.
 
I have been purposely vague in order to furnish you with broad interpretative latitude, but then, what are catalysts for, if not to be incomplete?
 
There is one additional suggestion I would like to share with you. We are entering a time when the ability to destroy the old and create the new is a skill set of unparalleled value. It takes great insight to detect the weakness of one’s own work and destroy it, while creating a new work in its place. Light, as it passes through prisms, becomes degraded over time and matter. In other words, informed entities will disperse a brighter, bolder, more visible spectrum of light if the light source is of their time, space, and matter.
 
I am of the opinion that the power is self-contained in the new. There is only the effect of dilution by constructing bridges and hybrid models. This work is about the destruction of the old as much as it is about the construction of the new. This is yet another trait of the non-aligned—the willingness, even eagerness, to flush the mind of the old in order to attract into oneself the new.
 
How can personal growth and global politics find common ground when there are such tremendous differences? Can you offer any advice for some of the fierce emotional battles that this material is stimulating, something to help us keep perspective? You addressed this somewhat after the 9-11 tragedy when you wrote the Reassurance Vibration (See question Terrorist Attacks of 9-11-01. Ed.), but can you offer any further insights into the present world situation?
 
In order to keep perspective amid the seeming chaos of global politics and their offspring, you need nothing more than to listen to music that resonates with your sense of beauty. Music is the therapy of the mind and spirit, which in turn influence the body. The entire physical body is an “ear” just as the entire mind is also an “ear.” These two “ears” regulate—in large measure—the levels of stress that impact on each individual.
I would also add that there is nothing to reconcile between the global and personal realms. What occurs on the global stage is part of a larger drama that provides individuals with a platform for discourse and interaction. Modern media simply makes these dramas more accessible in real-time, thus raising the level of stress because in real-time there is limited factual context. The facts emerge in the future—sometimes measured in days, sometimes in decades. Speculation is the fuel of dramas as well as human interactions. It is not necessary, or even desirable, that the personal realm be reconciled with global politics. What occurs in the personal realm is infinitely more transformational than what can occur in the global—particularly where politics is concerned.
 
My frustration has always been that these technicalities are wonderful, but with no way of verifying their reality in my own consciousness what real value do they have?
 
Remember that concepts and thoughts have both form and energy, even if they are not clearly evident to the human senses. Concepts, as vague as they may seem, possess an energy system that radiates from their deepest core. In other words, a person might have a vague concept of First Source, but no matter how vague the concept is it is linked to the deepest experience of First Source.
You can imagine that a concept has multiple levels of reality. One person can, for the first time, read a word like Spirit and gain a vague understanding, and, over the course of their lifetime, continually deepen their understanding. In some rare instances, they may even experience a state of connection to Spirit (or Source Intelligence). At the point of experience, they realize that the word Spirit is a hollow symbol, but one filled with a trace of the radiance or energy from the experience.
 
Think of it like this: a radiant ball of energy (like the sun) burns underneath all concepts related to First Source. Around this energy are thousands of layers of interpretation—some of these are words, some symbols, some emotions, some mental constructs, some are pictures, some are dreams, some are hopes, etc. However, every level contains some of the light and energy of that radiant ball of energy, and because of this, it magnetically pulls the consciousness of the individual deeper into awareness.
 
This is true of the technicalities you refer to. Verification is only accessible in personal experience, and even this is temporary within the three-dimensional world. I have known students, who have been granted wonderful exposure to these “radiant balls of energy”, and they often fall into doubt and even depression after the experience because they cannot sustain their belief that the experience was authentic.
 
In other words, even verification or personal experience is overrated. It only matters how you transfer your level of experience and knowledge into works that are aligned to the objectives of First Source and live your life according to the principles of the Sovereign Integral.
 
If you have a very basic knowledge of these concepts, but you live according to the principles of the Sovereign Integral and you produce expressions aligned to First Source, you have your verification in your words and deeds, and you add to the radiant energy system of these concepts.
 
The keyword is add to the radiant energy system, not experience them for purposes of verification. I know you might think that by verification or personal experience you would be better able to add to the radiant energy system, but only in rare instances is this true. For most, they become unbalanced and seek more experiences. Their desire to experience overpowers their desire to practice the simple, but powerful principles of the Sovereign Integral.
 
In using the WingMakers’ CD’s, will each of us notice any physical/ spiritual changes taking place within our bodies? Or will only some people?
 
No one who immerses within the WingMakers’ data stream will be unaffected. This is because of how the frequencies of the light and sound (from the art and music) will affect the thalamocortical system, and how this system, in turn, affects consciousness. How far the individual immerses in the data stream will define how well they are able to establish these new frequencies in their consciousness. [See the WingMakers’ fourth philosophy paper “Beliefs and their Energy Systems” for specific examples. Ed.]
Initially, an individual may encounter difficulties as a “clearing” of the old is made to accommodate the new frequencies, but if the individual proceeds and pushes beyond the clearing, they will be rewarded with a new sense of balance, expansion of consciousness, and most importantly, the new thought stream that proceeds from the WingMakers’ sensory data stream. These new thoughts produce new, creative actions and event-strings that lead to an entity’s purpose becoming manifest.
 
“There is encoded in each of the time capsules, a system of languages that can lead the individual to their core expression. It is hidden because it is so powerful. And we will only lead the worthy to this power.” (See “Shifting Models of Existence” p. 10. Ed.) Why is the word “worthy” used here? For me it evokes feelings of doubt and distrust as to the purpose of the whole WingMakers’ myth because I was taught in my religious upbringing that “only the worthy could enter the kingdom of heaven and only Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross could make us worthy.” What do you mean by worthy?
 
Worthiness, in this context, simply means that the individual has obtained a state of harmlessness where the power of the higher languages is not abused or applied for personal gain.
The emotional body is a renegade within the human instrument. It possesses great powers of will and determination, but it is also capricious and undisciplined. It is this volatile combination unmanaged that prevents the embodiment of the higher powers, which the human body was designed to contain and control. Those who are worthy have learned how to manage this element of their human instrument.
 
 
Will the next material give reference to the “Harmonic Concordance” that is being talked about now? This relates to a special astrological geometric pattern, which will be formed on November 8, 2003, at 8:12 a.m. EST. The primary feature is a Grand Sextile and at the time of total lunar eclipse. Does astrology play any part in the WingMakers philosophy or cosmology?
 
The teachings of Lyricus do not involve astrology. The reason is simple: astrology is subjective to time and place, and because of this subjectivity it is impossible to embed fundamental truth that is sustainable and relevant across multiple places and times. This does not suggest that heavenly bodies do not impact on humans. They most certainly do, in more ways than astrology recognizes.
The Harmonic Concordance—like all astronomical events that seem orderly (non-random)—is indicative of how the grander scale of the universe can imprint on the consciousness of a species and an individual. The universe is a powerful catalyst of the inborn instinct to ascend in consciousness, but our species has fallen to the gaze of a ten-foot experience called television, and seldom, if ever, searches the night sky.
 
Given that bio-technology is booming and that there are many ethical concerns about harvesting stem cells from fetuses, cloning etc., does the Hierarchy regard any of it as being useful? Or is it just humanity creating monsters on a higher turn of the evolutionary spiral as they did in Lemuria—but this time with more intelligence? Is the karma of that period working itself out now?
 
The research into cloning will uncover an important component of the Grand Portal. It is seen as vital research and is nearly always a necessary step on the path to discovery in a developing species. The human genome research does not, in and of itself, concern itself with the replicable nature of recombinant DNA, and it is this distinction that makes research into cloning valuable. There is within this study an emerging knowledge of how Primal DNA can be scientifically activated by interacting with the gatekeepers of a specific gene’s potential: histones.
The concept of cloning is decisively absent in any of the esoteric works, and yet I can tell you quite candidly that the investigation into cloning will yield a very critical component to the discovery of the Grand Portal. Again, when scientific vocabulary and constructs are absent from a religious body of work, the text will tend to gravitate to the etheric or the moral. The former being highly subjective and therefore relatively immaterial, and the latter expressing the bias of control and therefore is limiting. The masters of the Great White Lodge [Earth’s spiritual Hierarchy. Ed.] did not intend this; they simply lacked vocabulary and understanding.
 
 
In light of the above, and given that much karma works itself out generically through the human body, how does the Hierarchy regard science trying to cure cancer and other karmically engendered diseases, in utero or otherwise? In other words, how would the karma work itself out—through other physical means (i.e. the body might break down anyway, just like ‘Dolly’ the cloned sheep) or at another level?
 
The answer to this question lies in the law of natural selection. There are some conditions in life (and this is one of them) that are not caused by a higher spiritual law (karmic in nature), but rather are a result of fundamental physical principles like gravity. The law of natural selection is one of these. When you tamper with genetics via medical interventions, you are tampering with this law and you can expect repercussions.
Also, it is a false assumption that disease is “karmically engendered.” Disease is an outgrowth of many things, sometime it’s karmically related, but more times than not, it is an outgrowth of a deeper purpose: in this case, the discovery of soul. Without the medical technology that disease demands, the human soul would remain a fixture of faith and therefore, it would find its way into a subset of a species, but not carry the powerful import as when it is proven to exist by science.
 
Disease serves a purpose for the broader species even though it seems absurd in the context of the individual. The medical technology that a species develops to combat its own mortality is precisely the technical footing required for science to prove the existence of soul. [The Grand Portal. Ed.]
 
 
Is SARS a bio-weapon, and if so, who developed and employed it? Or is it a result of mass fear, as other flus are esoterically regarded?
 
SARS is a natural outgrowth of biodiversity and the fusion of organic species. There is nothing insidious about its outbreak that could not have been prevented by better hygiene.
 
DK said that in this century a disciple would come forth to carry on a third installment of the teachings that Blavatsky and Bailey started. Has that disciple come forth yet, and are those teachings in process of dissemination by a Master to a disciple? What form are these teachings in, or do they vary radically from that given forth previously? If so, which Master is doing this (DK?) and who is the disciple, or in what part of the world do they reside?
 
I’m unable to comment on this particular question at this time.
 
Was Patanjali a WingMaker and a member of Lyricus? With all due respect does the letter P in Master P refer to P(atanjali)?
 
Patanjali is not specifically concerned with Lyricus. He is associated with the planetary teaching order of this sector of the Milky Way galaxy. The sutras of Patanjali are designed to align an entity with the unification vibration instilled within the Wholeness Navigator.
Unfortunately, they were applied for other purposes by most initiates (e.g., mind control), and in this misapplication, their innate power was diminished.
 
Patanjali’s presence on earth is well obscured because of his extraterrestrial origins. He was an advanced thinker and academician of his time, and very few could understand his real teachings in regard to synchronizing the vibration of the Wholeness Navigator to the human instrument. [Patanjali was a Hindu philosopher who created a series of sutras describing a form of yoga related to the mind. This is often referred to as Raja Yoga. Ed.]
 
I am unable, at this time, to answer your question regarding Master P. [The Master P is referenced in the books by Alice Bailey and Djwhal Khul (DK). Ed.]
 
There are several references within The Urantia Book that seem to be corroborated by the WingMakers’ material. An example is the planetary reference number of earth. (This number is found on the First Source Disc CD-ROM. Ed.) Also, the cosmological structure as depicted in The Urantia Book seems similar in some respects to the WingMakers. How does The Urantia Book factor into the WingMakers’ materials?
 
The Urantia Book is a Tributary Zone. It is not associated with one of the seven Tributary Zones because these are encoded sensory data streams, and The Urantia Book is pure text without encoding. Nonetheless, it’s part of the collection of Tributary Zones for stage two as talked about in question seventeen. [See Christ: Mission and Work. Ed.]
The Urantia Book is most closely aligned with Lyricus’ cosmological sciences discipline, but it was not written or composed by Lyricus. It derives mostly from interdimensional sources—the equivalent of an earth-based teaching organization, only from a different planetary system. Sometimes planetary systems will exchange important writings or revelatory works for the purpose of circulating philosophical ideas or important revelations. This work is such an example.
 
 
After this someone asked why there was so much Urantia material in the WingMakers material. I answered that some of the cosmology fit in, but that, to paraphrase myself, “James mixes in material from various sources. For instance, Chakobsa is found in Frank Herbert’s book Dune.” I am curious about this myself and admit that The Urantia Book does not resonate well with me. Parts of it are quite fascinating and other parts are narrow minded and simplistic. For instance, with all due respect, although I generally understand the concept of the seven Superuniverses and the Grand Universe, etc., the diagram and explanations seem almost childish. (As depicted on The First Source disc CD-ROM. Ed.) For instance, most who have studied A Treatise on Cosmic Fire will consider the WM cosmology as expressed in terms of the Urantia model to be inferior by comparison. I am not saying that others or I fully understand TCF, but that the vision that it communicates is far more sophisticated than the simple presentation, to date, of the WM concept based at least partially on Urantia. (A Treatise on Cosmic Fire was published in 1925. The Tibetan teacher, Djwhal Khul, telepathically transmitted it to Alice A. Bailey. It is a deeply esoteric book on cosmology and other metaphysical subjects. Ed.)
 
This is an interesting topic. First, your assumption that the WingMakers’ materials are based on The Urantia Book is not accurate. Within this galaxy, the cosmology presented in The Urantia Book is considered one of the two best depictions of the structure of the Grand Universe. (The book referred to in the Ancient Arrow Project, Liminal Cosmogony, is considered the other.) It so happens that the WingMakers’ material is not based on this depiction, but rather it is based on the reality of the physical Grand Universe, which happens to coincide with the view held by The Urantia Book. I hold to the opinion that the works of AAB do not compare to The Urantia Book or Liminal Cosmogony in terms of its presentation of the cosmological structure of the physical universe.
A Treatise on Cosmic Fire is more concerned with the macrocosm and microcosm definitions as they pertain to a narrow field of view of the multiverse. Its insight and resulting presentation of the cosmological structure of the Grand Universe is unsubstantial, and its prolific use of the Eastern esoteric terminology provides a barrier to the Western mind, something that The Urantia Book does not. This is not a criticism of Cosmic Fire, but it is one of the reasons that the readership of The Urantia Book is more widespread than A Treatise on Cosmic Fire.
 
With regard to the simplistic approach to cosmology as contained in the current WingMakers’ material, this is done for several reasons. First it is not the purpose of these materials to teach the cosmology of the physical Grand Universe or the subtle fields of vibration known as the multiverse or multi-dimensional reality. There are books yet to come that will do this. The WingMakers’ material is designed to inspire newly incarnated personalities to their earthly purpose—the discovery of the Grand Portal. It is one of many works that will have this impact. It is a signpost, not an encyclopedia of knowledge. It is a catalyst, not an expository of spiritual or cosmological information.
 
Many talk of the significance of 2012 to mankind. What is the truth behind 2012?
Understand one thing, significance is a relative term. To me, for example, significance is measured by the degree in which humankind edges closer to the discovery of the Grand Portal. Thus, using my criteria, the year 2012 is not a particularly significant year. However, if someone is more attuned to the physical environment, the year 2012 may indeed hold some significant events.

层次结构所寻求实施的计划会不断地被修改。今天它的五个最主要的优先事项是什么？
 
优先级不是用数字来评估的。换句话说，在等级制度和数以百计的相关战术中存在着一个基本目的。一些战术可能比其他战术更有近期的重要性，在这个程度上，有一种优先感，但一切都属于一个单一的、进化的系统，使人类和灵魂的证明处于碰撞的过程中。
每一个进化系统都被设计成最终转变为具有新的、但相关的目的的创新系统。进化系统有一个独特的顶点，它是使转型发生的催化剂。就人类目前的进化系统而言，大门户的发现就是独特的高潮，当它发生时，它将把进化系统从人类物种/行星的焦点转移到跨维度物种/星际的焦点，基于人类使用大门户作为主权整体网络的接口的能力。
 
负责任地应用大门户的工作将由圣道的弟子来忠实地执行。今天所有的训练、准备和牺牲都是为了让未来的弟子能够负责任地管理和保护大门户的发现。这是等级制度的焦点，尽管并非所有等级制度的人都意识到这一总体目标及其高潮，预计在21世纪的后四分之一。
 
我的理解是，人类作为一个整体，以及地球本身和地球上的所有生命形式，正在经历最基本的巨大生物变化。我们中有些人有意识地意识到了这一点，即决定体现我们的灵魂、整体性导航者等的能量。我们中的许多人在十年前就开始了这个过程，并继续经历着身体上的剧烈疼痛和不适，以及抑郁症的发作和精神及情感上的挑战。有些人把这称为转型、升天、清除祖先的业力等。这是许多人关心的问题，请您对此发表意见。例如，到底发生了什么，随着觉醒过程的继续和/或结束，我们可以期待什么？
 
谢谢你的问题和对这个主题的兴趣。
诚然，在某些情况下，人类的工具正在发生变化，这些变化可以被体验到，有时是强烈的，有时是显著的微妙的。然而，更深刻的变化--那些涉及人类工具的基本结构--不一定表现为身体不适或情绪低落。
 
很多时候，身体的不适和情绪的动荡是由无数不相关的原因造成的，我相信你会同意，这些原因与人类仪器的这种基本进化没有关系。每个人都必须用他们的辨别力和自知之明来区分天气、饮食、压力条件等的影响和那些发生在原子或亚原子层面的更基本的变化。
 
人类的工具是一个复合结构。它不仅仅是身体。它包括心灵和情感智力的途径，这些途径与整体性导航仪的关系比身体更密切。整体性导航仪通过人类仪器更生动地表达其意识形式，这种表达使连接心灵和情感意识与整体性导航仪的路径获得能量，或成为 "桥梁"。
 
你可以把这些途径看成是一个根系。心灵和情感就像肉体的根，从整体性导航仪中汲取营养。如果 "整体性导航仪 "被激活，在物理、三维世界中更生动地表达自己，它的营养供应就会加强，头脑和情绪无疑会吸收这种加强，并将其传递给身体。
 
整体性导航仪的存在对人类工具来说是不可见的，而且在大多数情况下，不能直接感受到。心灵的高级通道想象它，这些图像通过音乐转化为情感和身体，就像任何艺术形式一样生动。每个人对这些翻译的反应都有些不同；没有标准的反应。
 
重要的是要明白，"整体性领航者 "的存在正压迫到物理层面，并留下其不可磨灭的影响。发生这种情况的原因有很多，但最值得注意的是，此时化身为人的个人有意识地，在某些情况下是下意识地，呼唤整体性领航者的意识，将其统一能量辐射到人类工具上。
 
我意识到这可能不是有意识的恳求或祈祷，但它是公报的隐藏形式，当这样做时，整体性导航仪加强了它的振动共鸣。人类的工具因此开始激活，或发生变化。这种变化是非常基本的，一般感觉到对压力越来越敏感，在肉体上，可以表现为头痛和身体疼痛，四肢麻木，能量快速激增和耗尽。
 
这方面的生理原因与第十条染色体有关，也与它如何调节身体、心灵和情绪的压力应对能力有关。整体性导航仪是由人类仪器召唤出来的，而人类仪器是由整体性导航仪的强化激活的。人类仪器的激活对DNA结构、大脑化学和中枢神经系统造成深刻的变化。
 
这种激活是人类工具的自然进化。它产生于对统一和整体感的渴望，而这正是人类仪器被设计为阻碍的东西。请记住，人类仪器是使整体性导航者在时间和空间领域内体验分离和个体化经验的东西。因此，如果它要体现出统一的振动，它就必须转变。
 
这种转变并不像你的问题所暗示的那样广泛发生。它只限于整个人类人口中一小部分人的工具。我知道有报告称，整个地球正在经历不折不扣的全球转变，但事实并非如此。蜕变是应个人的要求，一次一个人发生的。它不是为所有的生命形式同时安排的，因为这将需要停止自由意志。
 
随着越来越多的人呼唤 "整体性领航者"，并随后改变他们人类工具的功能，新一代的人类就更容易在他们的人类工具中体现出统一的振动。这都是人类进化的神圣蓝图的一部分，人类是能够进行宇宙学探索的灵魂载体。
 
我希望这个解释，虽然简短而且承认是抽象的，但对你的理解有帮助。就像任何如此巨大的主题一样，我可以写上一百页，但也只能触及这个主题的表面。只写了几页，你可以想象这种渲染是多么的不充分。然而，时间不允许我向你们提供所有的细节。
 
听到你解释了塑造人类互动和命运的两种形式的主导存在模式--进化/奴役模式和变革/主人翁模式，我感到很欣慰。你说，认识这两种主导的存在模式并将其整合以设计综合模式是个人的挑战。你能描述一下这个综合模式，以及它对整个人类来说可能是什么样子？
 
综合模式首先立足于对你是谁的基本认识。这就要求你理解并尽可能地体验作为你多方面身份的个性化意识。当大门户被发现时，个体意识将被--实际上是--解剖，并首次显现出来；在某些方面类似于人体首次被解剖，其内部器官被命名并确定其用途。
这是人类普遍存在的综合模式的曙光。它的主要特点是，就公众可见而言，它为不朽和人类相互联系的信仰体系带来了验证感。在大多数经历这一过程的星球上，存在的综合模式在大门户的发现和传播阶段出现了曙光。它对机构的完整性产生了根本性的理想影响--也就是说，任何基于以前的存在模式的机构都会萎缩，要么调整其组织规则，要么自我终结。[见词汇表中的存在模式。］
 
什么是获得和体验更高的权力，或 "超级 "人类心灵状态的最佳和最容易的方式。我指的是任何像马吉克、卓越的智力和类似的东西--我想你明白我的意思。
 
我被问到这个问题（或其变体）的次数比其他任何问题都多，而我的回答不可避免地是一样的：将你的个人目标与普遍目标相一致。换句话说，如果你把精力集中在寻找与你的意识产生共鸣并导致你自我超越的感官数据流上，这些同样的数据流将照亮普遍目标，因为它们与你所处的物种和你的物种所处的星球有关。一旦意识到这一点--哪怕是朦胧的--你就可以将你的个人道路与宇宙接轨。当做到这一点时，你会以最适合你的意识的速度加速，同时保持平衡。
专注于与你对普遍目标的核心本能感觉相一致的东西。我曾大胆断言，在人类科学无可辩驳的实验室中发现人类的灵魂是普遍目标的下一阶段，因为它与人类和地球有关。如果这与你的核心目的感有共鸣，那么就向它看齐。这将加速、放大和催化你主权整体意识状态的蓝图。
 
无知的焦虑[这个答案与许多灵修学生的情况有关，他们觉得自己不再完全参与日常世界，但同时又觉得自己没有完全进入精神世界。在心理学上，他们觉得自己处于两个世界之间。见32-S3。编者按】。］
 
至于你的问题，人类的仪器是一个复杂的、错综复杂的容器，你和这个时代的所有人类一样，对它的了解程度很低（尽管有现代科学）。
 
人类的工具是在多个层面、多个时空维度上运作的，对精神能量极为敏感。这不是在世界之间的功能；这是无知的焦虑。对自己的无知感到焦虑是完全自然的。所有人类在不同程度上都有这种焦虑。它不是为那些在自我启蒙道路上的人保留的；尽管事实上它在 "灵魂的黑夜"、"灵性化的感知滞后 "或 "自我启动的失败主义 "等词汇中得到了阐述，这些词汇已经成为--我的同事们所说的--启动者的抱怨词汇。
 
你以幽默的方式（在信中）讲述了你的经历。我赞扬你的幽默感。这无疑给我的脸上带来了笑容。幽默是对抗无知的焦虑的绝佳武器。请记住，希望它能让你感觉更好，你是在非常好的公司。
 
无知的焦虑与人类工具本身一样无所不在，它的普遍性是由于人类工具无法通过心灵 "认识自己 "的现实。它只能通过整体性导航仪来认识自己，但矛盾的是，这种认识不是以人类工具可以接受的形式出现的。
 
在你的下一个版本中，是否有可能给出计划、图表、电路和组件，以方便在ACIO使用的RV集的方式后直接链接到WingMakers。
 
恐怕不行。如果你想与造翼者沟通，你只需要应用第四室哲学文件中的技术，并应用第一室哲学中概述的原则。这两篇论文是适应造翼者频率的非常强大的元素。这并不是说你会用语言交流，而是你会享受到他们意识的无误存在。仅仅这一点就是使自己与普遍目标相一致的关键方法。
创翼者在梦境中进行大部分的交流，因为丘脑皮层系统的大门相对关闭，完全专注于眼前的内在交流。如果你愿意沉浸在WingMakers的材料中，你可以有把握地认为你已经和这个教学组织的成员有了默契。你很可能在梦境中体验到支流区，在这些老师中的一个或多个的指导下。向这种可能性敞开你的心扉，把它活生生地梦到你的感官。
 
既然WingMakers的许多材料似乎是为后代准备的，那么当代人（例如老年人）有什么理由去阅读或研究这些材料呢？
 
如果任何材料在你内心深处作为真理产生共鸣，允许它进入。一旦内化，允许它自由退出。如果它留在身边，你就为你不断发展的信仰系统找到了宝贵的资产。如果它离开或进入冬眠状态，这只意味着你有理由继续寻找。
这同样适用于WingMakers的材料。它并不打算成为感官数据流的独家收集，恰恰相反。现在有一些实体化身，他们将在未来一百年内以人类的身份回归，他们将在大门户的揭幕和传播中发挥重要作用。他们现在对这些材料的参与将帮助他们导航到这些角色，因为这将重新调整他们的内部价值体系，在某些情况下，实际上是重新铸造他们的命运。
 
此外，虽然大门户的实际发现最终可能归功于少数人，但它将是数百万实体的成就，他们将自己的智慧、行动和灵感想法嫁接在一起，构建了人类精神的最终马赛克。任何参与这些工作的人都将是这幅马赛克的一部分。[另见：大门户发现的意义。 编者注] 。
 
 
等级制度认为人类中有多大比例的人a）正在接受第一次启蒙教育。
 
愿望的 "屋顶"，在任何神圣道路上的神圣的启动者中，并不包括学位，甚至不包括它们所代表的来之不易的成就。它包括他们的灵魂对扩大他们各自物种的进化条件的贡献。正是由于这个原因，在等级制度的眼中，入会并不特别重要，也不被看作是荣誉的徽章或更高目标的证书。
尽管如此，我理解你问题的性质，我将给你一些一般性的指导。目前在地球上化身的入会者略少于十万人，他们都在遵循等级制度松散地建立的智慧之路。也就是说，他们遵循大师们提出的原则，并在日常生活中践行这些原则。并非无懈可击，而是具有人类不一致的品质。
 
 
学生要学习升天者的神秘之道，是否需要入会？
 
我是对光商、升天时间表、启动、升天座位等概念有一定程度的不容忍的教师之一。这些概念属于旧的支流区，它们被那些被旧的等级制度中的师生秩序灌输的支流区的棱镜所延续。这个特殊的学生是在很小的时候就被这些概念所浸染，无法完全放开它们。
当这种心态的学生遇到像我这样的老师时，往往会让他们感到不安，因为我会像解开木乃伊的包装一样撕开灌输的内容，将其脆弱的皮肤暴露在阳光下。如果学生能挺过这一关，他们会对自己的角色有不同的看法。他们将走一条建立在自己内在智慧上的主权之路，而这可能与等级制度或阿斯拉米工作或这个或那个射线没有任何关系。[詹姆斯指的是七种射线，见于神学和爱丽丝-贝利/德瓦尔-库尔（DK）哲学。编者注]。这将是关于实体的实时表达，以及这种表达如何与它的生命错综复杂地联系在一起的人产生共鸣。它是关于生活在主权整体的生命原则。
 
回到这个人身上，有一天他来找我，宣布他打算离开。他觉得有一段时间需要回到他的灌输中（我的话，不是他的话），像浪子一样回到他的主人身边。他觉得我没有继承作为以言传身教的大师的传统，我太迷恋通过艺术、音乐、心理学等进行教学。对他来说，他需要一个能告诉他做什么、去哪里、怎么去、到了之后做什么的老师。
 
 
我意识到你对入会级别不感兴趣，但仅仅作为一个参考点，上面的描述让我想起了第二和第三入会之间的那个点，DK将其称为人类进化的最困难阶段，（至少在地球上）。弟子/学生处于一种心理上的无人之境，在两个世界之间行走。你是这样认为的吗？
 
我不主张启动级别，是有原因的。它假定有一个过程可以强加在人类工具上或应用在人类工具上，预示着一个规定的结果。然而，被要求忠实地体验这个过程的入门者，他们的意识没有得到充分的发展，不知道谁在做 "处方"，也不知道与他们个人有关的结果是什么。因此，他们对一个看不见的 "处方者 "进行盲目的信仰--这种情况使人类工具逐渐觉醒，过度依赖统一的过程。
 
 
在高层看来，今天弟子的主要责任是什么？它们是否与过去一样，例如，对印象缺乏敏感度、惰性、恐惧、物质主义等责任？
 
在这里，等级制度也不是一致的。从Lyricus（我最了解他的观点）的角度来看，今天的门徒有三大责任。
1.他们在CoD（Caves of Disconnection）中运作，这破坏了合作和分享的精神，而这种精神是刷新和振兴教义所需的。山洞的比喻也与这个问题有关，因为弟子的自然倾向是让深奥的教义保持深奥。这不仅适用于白色小屋的智慧之路，也适用于遗传学、粒子物理学、声光理论、宇宙学、新心理学等相关领域。弟子们需要在所有这些领域教育自己，因为它们都与向人类招手的东西有关。
 
2.圣道的教义既不僵化也不完整。门徒们必须保持他们的灵活性和意愿，不仅要把当代教义发展到新的表达领域，而且要寻找教义如何与正在出现的新教义合成或混合。门徒们有责任锁定在传统的范式中，为了自我和熟悉的舒适感而保护它们的知识魅力。
 
3.密宗很难变成外在的，除非它清楚地显示出在弟子的生活中体现出的道德性质。换句话说，正确关系的一致性和向善的意愿在个人的生活流中被忠实地表达出来。这需要对自己的沟通采取特别有纪律的方法，而我使用的是沟通这一术语的最广泛含义。
4.
世界上的门徒可以集中精力在哪些主要领域，以加快等级制度的工作？
 
除了克服上面简单提到的责任外，没有什么需要关注的。我理解你问题的性质，但等级制度不需要门徒们有意识地、刻意地集中精力来执行或加快其使命。
 
学生要学习升天者的深奥之道，是否需要入会？(接续自《入门》39-S3A。编辑)
 
......我向他告别，解释说我的决心是创造工具，而不是指导我所说的神秘的细节（MOTE）。但对这个学生来说，这正是他所需要的。深奥的细枝末节是支持他对被称为奥秘知识的精英主义的需求的脚手架。
体验 "整体性导航仪 "与MOTE没有任何关系，这种体验就是我的教学内容。体验全能领航者的问题是，对一些学生来说，他们发现自己无法成为教师，这也是大多数学生或倡议者来到我门前的原因。他们渴望成为MOTE的老师，虽然他们伪装成精神的学生。
 
为什么？因为作为MOTE的教师，他们突然属于等级制度，希望把自己像升空的火箭一样发射到天堂，在那里一切都有可能。潜伏的、潜意识中的方程式。对MOTE的掌握 + 上升的大师 + 启动过程 = 控制。因此，当学生来找我时，我仔细检查他们的意图，从灌输的人工制品中过滤出对 "整体性领航者 "经验的真实愿望，这些人工制品造成了对MOTE的倾斜。
 
控制是引导许多学生到我门前的灌输神器，尽管他们一般都没有意识到这一点。我想请你思考这个问题。审视你的意图，看看你是想要经验还是知识。如果对 "整体性领航者 "的体验高于控制，如果对 "整体性领航者 "的表达高于对MOTE的获取，那么两者并不相互排斥。
 
我将暂时回到我在这封信前面提到的情景。如果你是当代支流区的一个棱镜，与你的心和思想产生共鸣，而你的那一部分，被称为整体性导航者，作为你的老师出现，你会看到你不是一个特定形状的具体化的棱镜，但你可以转变为任何想要的几何形状。
 
这就是体验整体性导航仪和表达其天生能力的魅力。你不是在保护或宣扬MOTE；你不是渴望教导和控制的入门者；你不是在鹦鹉学舌；相反，你是在透明地将当代支流区转变为分散的人类群众，他们正在寻求一个新的方向，这个方向被艺术和个人经验的工具所照亮，这些工具已经被减速到他们的特殊需要。
 
最后，我想让你知道，我并不是在指责我所知道的阿斯拉马的使命的价值，而是指你所知道的。你们通过尚未意识到其整体性导航仪的棱镜的话语来了解它们。你通过其他倡议从过时的支流区所表达的MOTE来了解它们。层次结构中的分化和专业化比人们承认的要少得多。大师们对MOTE不感兴趣......入门者们才感兴趣。
 
西藏人告诉我们，我们的太阳是我们当地OOWNMBS（One About Whom Naught May Be Said）的心脏中心。这就是天狼星系统的心脏中心吗？
 
我知道在一群弟子中对这件事有很大的猜测。请理解，从Lyricus的角度来看，任何弟子对此事的猜测似乎都很奇怪，当然，除非他们对自己独立意识的解剖结构有完整的理解。而根据我的经验，这种情况即使有，也是非常少的。
先天下之忧而忧，这是一条古老的法令，外部宇宙的变化无常，虽然从好奇心的角度来看很有趣，但与了解个人的宇宙相比，并不特别相关。
 
对你的问题的简单回答是：不。然而，我没有详细说明你的问题，而是选择把重点放在 "神秘人"（MOTE）的问题上。MOTE创造了一种伸缩性的复杂性，只要一个人的个人宇宙的基础是清晰的，并且被很好地理解，这种复杂性就可以被整合，并且很有用。另一方面，如果个人的宇宙被模糊地理解，那么MOTE将完全起到另一个作用。
 
Lyricus把这种对外询问和猜测的条件称为MOTE，这并不是一种巧合。城堡周围的护城河[MOTE]是一种保护和加固的形式。把你的个人宇宙想象成城堡的隐喻，MOTE是护城河，而宇宙或外部宇宙是潜在的敌人，你的护城河[MOTE]就是为了击退他们。如果你建造一条护城河[MOTE]，你只有在相信外部会入侵内部并以某种方式削弱、减弱甚至摧毁它时才会这样做。
 
在创造的顺序中，内部产生外部，因此，不需要摩特，当然，除非创造者对他们的创造没有把握。这是要思考的关键因素。
 
我知道有一些人会告诉你，宇宙是由一个绝对的、客观的现实组成的。毕竟，对于所有居住在地球上的人来说，太阳是太阳系的中心，这是准确的。虽然有关于地理和空间关系的固定规则，但几乎没有其他东西可以如此明确地被 "钉死"，即使在物理世界中，我们称之为多元宇宙的最密集的振动集合场。
 
然而，当一个人把视野投向MEST维度（MEST--物质、能量、空间和时间）之外时，他们会觉醒地意识到，这些超级维度提供了一个主观的组成部分，是敏锐的个人化、可塑性和反应性。这些振动场支持个体化和不朽的意识的原始冲动，这些意识在其表达的所有世界中定义其现实，包括MEST维度。如果不是因为MEST密度所必须的感知滞后，这种创造性的流动将是清晰可见的。
 
如你所知，有一种心理状况有时被称为共识现实。如果五千名圣道弟子说天狼星的心脏中心是我们的太阳，而只有五个人说它不是，那么共识现实决定了这五个反对者是错误的或被误导的。
 
我问你一个简单的问题：当MEST只是个人内心更有活力的世界的一个遥远的回声或人工制品时，为什么会有老师关心支配或甚至权衡MEST的共识现实？
 
根据我的观察，MOTE的状况部分是等级制度对其知识分配的排序和强调的结果，部分是个人和宇宙领域真正完整的产物。
 
这两种境界就像连体婴儿，有不同的个性、思想和气质，却被迫作为一个身体行走。身体成为妥协的固定物，成为无序的衣服。在连在一起的世界中存在一定的混乱，或者说无序，因为就像相互竞争的引力场，它们把你拉向不同的方向。
 
在Lyricus内部，我们有一句话。内在的东西是无以伦比的，它产生于最小的空间，在那里，未显现的第一振动在一个世界的恩典的光辉中涌动。在这里你是创造者-感知者，也是感知者-创造者，是决定命运的人。这一点你可以控制。你可以为所有时代体现这一点。
 
在MEST世界内的东西，你只能把你的精力和时间给许多人或少数人的短暂现实。
 
我知道我很深奥，而且对你最初的问题有点漠不关心，但如果你仔细看，你会看到你的答案--不是在字面上，而是在文字背后的意识里。
 
西里安系统是以大熊为头部中心的人的太阳神经丛中心吗？
 
我再次理解并感谢你对理解这些问题的渴望，但冒着重复的风险，我说的任何话--与你的问题有关--如何能帮助你更深入地理解那位应该被内向认识的人（你）。如果你允许自己被拉向这些方向，那么你就准备好被那些把你拉向MOTE以捍卫你对OOBIK的无知的脱离轨道的力量所失望。
对MOTE知识的渴望主要是自我的功能。有许多高度发达的灵性教师，其启蒙程度超过了第七级，但他们无法告诉你关于非物质文化遗产问题的基本答案。这是因为共识的现实--MEST中许多人的现实--在他们的教义中没有相关性。我认识一位老师，他在心轮最深奥的层面上很有天赋，但如果你问他一个问题，比如S3（神圣的声音符号）与调色板和下丘脑的268条细胞经络线是什么关系，他会耸耸肩。他渴望知道答案，但只是因为这可能与他的专业领域有关，因为个体意识的能量系统是整体的、统一的。
 
然而，如果提出的问题是宇宙级的，就像你的第一个问题，他可能知道答案，但很可能会把你的注意力转向个人层面，提醒你--就像我一样--在你的探索领域扩展到宇宙之前，首先了解你是由什么组成的，你是什么，你与第一源的关系是什么，你的服务/业是什么，你向你的个人宇宙投射什么以及为什么。
 
"text-indent:2.3em;">根据我的经验，最好的老师会把对宇宙MOTE的探究首先转向对OWOBIK的基本理解，其次是对OWOBIK的深奥理解，第三是OWOBIK与起源和命运的关系[第三]，第四是OWOBIK与宇宙计划的关系[第四]，最后是个人将发挥其精神天赋的专业化道路[第五]。这个序列的每个阶段都不是与其他阶段密不可分的。它们之间的墙壁是多孔的，但尽管如此，教师仍然保持着各个阶段的重点区域。
 
请理解，如果我在你面前，我可以问你十个关于人类耳脑复合体的问题，你会让我失望十次；不是因为这些信息在你当地的图书馆或书店没有，而是因为你没有研究它。我向你保证，这比遥远的太阳系的宇宙学秩序更需要了解。
 
我的回答是否意味着弟子永远不应该询问宇宙的MOTE？只要你了解它的影响，并意识到它的先天缺陷，这种探究方式就没有错。这条规则有例外吗？是的，总是有的。
 
我见过一些学生对宇宙MOTE有天生的天赋，这也是他们佛法专业的一个重要组成部分。这些人往往迷恋宇宙MOTE，尽力去阐述和验证他们的直觉感受，这通常是其他生命的人工制品或意识的门户，对他们的意识感知是潜移默化的。这些学生就像侦探在黑暗的房间里寻找隐藏的电灯开关。
 
他们的信念--可能是潜意识的--是如果他们能把灯的开关扔到 "开 "的位置，他们的启蒙就得到了保证；他们的业力得到了清除，他们可以适当地控制自己的命运了。现实是，黑暗的房间不是宇宙的，是个人的，黑暗是唤醒 "侦探 "认识自我的动力。宇宙的MOTE是一路上的主要干扰因素。
 
令人激动和值得你投入精力的是--因为它与宇宙有关--前形式和前认知方面：极性背后的统一性。多元宇宙是最终的开放系统，总是自我修正并寻求其种子振动的动态平衡。个人是这个宏观系统的一个粒子，在共鸣中振动。在个人最深层的核心中，它已经理解了关于宇宙的必要知识，它处于模仿多元宇宙的预形成方面的发展、进化状态。
 
正如我们之前读到的，整体性导航仪是第一源泉的片段，具有所有固有的能力。因此，它有可能按要求提供所有知识。为什么W.N.需要在非物理的支流区室中 "教育 "自己，并依赖它们？不是有人说过，人所需要的一切都已经包含在自我之中了吗？"主权 "允许解放信息的来源包含在本体中，创造新现实所需的一切也包含在本体中。每个人都必须了解他们自己，以摆脱一切形式的外部依赖。"
 
你已经说出了一个问题，这个问题几乎潜伏在每一个深奥的学生心中。如果所有的知识都在自我之内，为什么学生需要指导？
你问题中的关键词是 "潜力"。"是的，人类工具通过源头智能与第一源头有着内在的联系。是的，这种连接提供了获取无限和动态知识的途径，然而，这个访问点，或门户不是一个简单的东西，可以有意识地调整，也不是 "按需 "由个人决定。与源智能的接触是一种变革性的体验，如果个人没有做好准备，可能会产生意想不到的后果，使其失去平衡。
 
降低声音和光线的振动，让学生更容易接受，是Lyricus主要关注的问题。Lyricus不建议任何人依赖任何外部教师或材料。这样做意味着相对于一个人潜在的学习路径来说，停滞不前和退化。造翼者的材料旨在催化个人意识中的特定受体，并创造一种共鸣。通过这种共鸣，个人将 "点击进入 "他们自己的觉醒-启示-转变，通过这个过程，他们可以更有效地摆脱外部指导和依赖。
 
 
讨论区的人是否因为我们参与这些材料而受到任何组织的威胁？
 
没有。
 
 
讨论区是否在导致WingMakers揭幕的事件串中发挥了作用？
 
目前不是以直接的方式，但总有一天，讨论论坛将成为使新加入的SECU协调其意识形态和愿景的更多因素。
 
为什么有些人变得与精神组织无缘？我觉得我应该成为教会或宗教机构的一部分，建立我真正的位置，但我有一部分人觉得我的存在方式对我的成长是必要的。
 
有信息的实体不结盟是有原因的。他们希望在思想进化和吸收新能量时能做到流畅自如。这是很高尚的。这不是什么令人不安的事情，也不是对它的不尊重。相反，这是一个迹象，表明你尊重你意识的流动性，而不是它的灌输。
你的 "真实位置 "根本不是一个地方、位置、港口或地点，而是主权整体意识的态度或前景的投影。让我这样解释。想象一下下面的情景：一束光，一个棱镜，以及从这个光谱中投射到墙上的七条单独的光线。想象一下你自己俯视这个场景。有四个可识别的组成部分，不是吗？
 
1.光束
 
2.棱镜
 
3.七种射线的光谱
 
4.墙壁
 
现在，让我们更深入地研究这个场景。墙是由材料构成的，因此墙可以被简化为其组成部分（石头、混凝土、砂浆、砖块等）。我们都知道，光谱代表了数百万种颜色，尽管只有七种是我们的眼脑可以立即识别的。光束有一个起源，一个波长，和一个目的地。因此，一切都有一个多重性，但棱镜除外。
 
棱镜仍然是单一的和主权的。它是催化的力量，部分原因是这种单一性。在这个时代，被告知的实体正在转变为催化剂或 "棱镜"，而支流区可以被比作光束。你可以开始把自己看成这个棱镜，把支流区的光束投射到你选择的墙上。作为一个棱镜，你不再关心自己隶属于哪条光线，也不再关心这条光线落在墙上的位置。[这里，詹姆斯指的是神学和爱丽丝-贝利/DK哲学中的七条射线的理论。编者按】。］
 
让我们转到这个场景中的一个新的探究点。什么是棱镜？棱镜是一种透明的光学器件，其形状可以弯曲（转换）光线。由于材料的折射率随波长的变化而变化，所以棱镜对于分散不同波长的光很有用。当光从空气中进入固体材料时，光的传播速度会降低。光线被减速，或被降级。如果光以一个非正常的角度进入，光的方向就会改变。光线被折射到一个新的路径上，可以照亮其中。
 
考虑一下这个场景，因为它适用于你的 "地方"。"注意斜体字，以及它们如何转到你自己对使命和目的的定义上。还要注意，棱镜可以被塑造成各种各样的几何形状，也可以有反棱镜。三角形、等边形（60°角）的棱镜与六面体的棱镜对光线的分散和减速不同。
 
如果知情实体可以被比喻为棱镜，那么剩下的问题就只有以下几个了。
 
- 我分散和减速（使之可理解）什么光束？
 
- 我在什么墙上散布光谱？
 
- 我在哪里定位才能最佳地处理光束？
 
- 我选择成为哪种类型和形状的棱镜？
 
你看到你的问题是如何被转移或重组的吗？实际上，我一直是你问题的一个棱镜。现在你的问题已经被分散到一堵新墙上，它可以在新的光线下被看到。在这个新的光线中，它不再是关于隶属关系、结盟或停靠港。它是关于四个答案，类似于选择。
 
我故意含糊其辞，以便为你提供广泛的解释空间，但是，如果不是为了不完整，催化剂又是为了什么？
 
有一个额外的建议，我想与你分享。我们正在进入这样一个时代：破旧立新的能力是一种具有无可比拟价值的技能。发现自己作品的弱点并摧毁它，同时在其位置上创造一个新的作品，这需要很强的洞察力。光，当它通过棱镜时，会随着时间和物质的变化而变质。换句话说，如果光源是他们的时间、空间和物质，知情的实体会散发出更明亮、更大胆、更明显的光谱。
 
我认为，权力在新事物中是自成一体的。只有通过构建桥梁和混合模式，才有稀释的效果。这项工作既是对旧事物的破坏，也是对新事物的构建。这也是不结盟者的另一个特点--愿意，甚至热衷于冲破旧的思想，以吸引新的东西进入自己。
 
当存在如此巨大的差异时，个人成长和全球政治如何能找到共同点？你能为这些材料所刺激的一些激烈的情感斗争提供一些建议，帮助我们保持观点吗？你在9-11悲剧发生后写《安心的振动》时多少谈到了这个问题（见9-11-01恐怖袭击的问题。 编辑），但你能对目前的世界局势提供进一步的见解吗？
 
为了在全球政治及其后代的看似混乱的情况下保持观点，你只需要听一听与你的美感产生共鸣的音乐。音乐是对心灵和精神的治疗，而心灵和精神又会影响身体。整个身体是一只 "耳朵"，正如整个心灵也是一只 "耳朵"。"这两只 "耳朵 "在很大程度上调节着影响每个人的压力水平。
我还想补充一点，全球和个人领域之间没有什么可以调和的。在全球舞台上发生的事情是一个更大的戏剧的一部分，它为个人提供了一个讨论和互动的平台。现代媒体只是使这些戏剧更容易被实时地接触到，从而提高了压力的水平，因为在实时的情况下，事实背景有限。事实是在未来出现的--有时是以天为单位，有时是以几十年为单位。猜测是戏剧的燃料，也是人类互动的燃料。个人领域与全球政治相协调是不必要的，甚至是不可取的。发生在个人领域的事情比发生在全球领域的事情具有无限的变革性，特别是在涉及政治的时候。
 
我的挫折感一直是，这些技术性的东西很好，但如果没有办法在我自己的意识中验证它们的真实性，它们有什么真正的价值？
 
请记住，概念和思想都有形式和能量，即使它们对人类的感官来说并不清晰可见。概念，尽管看起来很模糊，但拥有一个能量系统，从其最深的核心辐射出来。换句话说，一个人可能对第一源泉有一个模糊的概念，但无论这个概念多么模糊，它都与第一源泉的最深层经验有关。
你可以想象，一个概念有多个层面的现实。一个人可以第一次读到像精神这样的词，获得一个模糊的理解，并且在他们的一生中，不断加深他们的理解。在一些罕见的情况下，他们甚至可能体验到与精神（或源头智慧）的连接状态。在体验的那一刻，他们意识到精神这个词是一个空洞的符号，但其中充满了来自体验的光芒或能量的痕迹。
 
可以这样想：在所有与第一源头有关的概念下，有一个辐射状的能量球（像太阳）在燃烧。围绕着这个能量，有成千上万的解释层--其中有些是文字，有些是符号，有些是情绪，有些是心理构造，有些是图片，有些是梦想，有些是希望，等等。然而，每一层都包含了那颗光芒四射的能量球的一些光和能量，正因为如此，它以磁力将个人的意识拉向更深的意识。
 
你提到的技术性问题也是如此。只有在个人经验中才能得到验证，即使是在三维世界中，这也是暂时的。我认识一些学生，他们被赋予了接触这些 "能量辐射球 "的美妙机会，但他们在体验后常常陷入怀疑，甚至抑郁，因为他们无法维持他们的信念，即这种体验是真实的。
 
换句话说，即使是验证或个人经验也被高估了。唯一重要的是你如何将你的经验和知识水平转移到与第一源泉的目标相一致的作品中，并按照主权整体的原则生活。
 
如果你对这些概念有非常基本的了解，但你按照主权整体的原则生活，你产生了与第一源头相一致的表达，你在你的言行中得到了验证，你增加了这些概念的辐射能量系统。
 
关键词是添加到辐射能量系统中，而不是为了验证而体验它们。我知道你可能认为，通过验证或个人经验，你会更好地增加辐射能量系统，但只有在极少数情况下才是这样。对于大多数人来说，他们会变得不平衡，寻求更多的经验。他们对经验的渴望超过了他们对实践主权整体的简单但强大的原则的渴望。
 
在使用WingMakers的CD时，我们每个人都会注意到我们身体内发生的任何身体/精神变化吗？还是只有一些人可以注意到？
 
沉浸在WingMakers的数据流中的人都会受到影响。这是因为光和声音的频率（来自艺术和音乐）会影响丘脑皮层系统，以及这个系统如何反过来影响意识。个人沉浸在数据流中的程度将决定他们在意识中建立这些新频率的能力如何。[具体的例子请看WingMakers的第四篇哲学论文《信仰和他们的能量系统》。编者按】。］
最初，一个人可能会遇到困难，因为要 "清除 "旧的频率以适应新的频率，但如果个人继续前进并推动清除，他们将得到新的平衡感、意识的扩展，以及最重要的，从WingMakers的感官数据流中产生的新思想流的回报。这些新的思想产生新的、创造性的行动和事件串，导致一个实体的目的成为现实。
 
"在每个时间胶囊中都有编码，有一套语言系统，可以引导个人的核心表达。它被隐藏起来，因为它是如此强大。而我们将只引导有价值的人获得这种力量。"（见 "存在模式的转变 "第10页。 编辑）为什么这里使用 "值得 "这个词？对我来说，它唤起了我对整个WingMakers神话的目的的怀疑和不信任，因为在我的宗教教育中，我被教导 "只有值得的人才能进入天国，只有耶稣在十字架上的牺牲才能使我们值得。" 你说的配得上是什么意思？
 
在这里，"值得 "仅仅意味着个人已经获得了一种无害的状态，在这种状态下，高级语言的力量不会被滥用或用于个人利益。
情绪体是人类工具中的一个叛逆者。它拥有强大的意志和决心，但它也是任性和无纪律的。正是这种不稳定的组合没有得到管理，阻碍了更高力量的体现，而人体的设计是为了容纳和控制这些力量。那些有价值的人已经学会了如何管理他们人类工具的这个元素。
 
 
下一个材料会不会提到现在正在谈论的 "和谐一致"？这与一个特殊的星象几何模式有关，它将在2003年11月8日美国东部时间上午8点12分形成。主要特征是大六合，而且是在月全食的时候。占星术在WingMakers的哲学或宇宙学中是否扮演了任何角色？
 
Lyricus的教义不涉及占星术。原因很简单：占星术对时间和地点具有主观性，由于这种主观性，不可能嵌入可持续的、与多个地方和时间相关的基本真理。这并不是说天体对人类没有影响。它们当然会影响，而且影响的方式比占星术所承认的还要多。
和谐协奏曲--像所有看起来有秩序（非随机）的天文事件--表明宇宙的更大尺度如何在一个物种和个人的意识中留下印记。宇宙是一种强大的催化剂，让人在意识上有一种与生俱来的升华本能，但我们的物种已经沦落到被称为电视的十英尺经验的注视下，很少，如果有的话，搜索夜空。
 
鉴于生物技术正在蓬勃发展，而从胎儿身上采集干细胞、克隆等方面存在许多伦理方面的问题，等级制度是否认为这些技术是有用的？还是说这只是人类在进化螺旋的更高阶段创造了怪物，就像他们在雷姆利亚所做的那样--但这次有了更多的智慧？那段时期的因果报应现在是否正在发挥作用？
 
对克隆的研究将揭开大门户的一个重要组成部分。它被看作是重要的研究，几乎总是发展中物种发现道路上的必要步骤。人类基因组研究本身并不关注重组DNA的可复制性，正是这种区别使得对克隆的研究具有价值。在这项研究中，有一种新兴的知识，即原始DNA如何通过与特定基因潜力的守门员：组蛋白相互作用而被科学地激活。
克隆的概念在任何神秘的作品中都是决定性的，然而我可以很坦率地告诉你，对克隆的调查将产生发现大门户的一个非常关键的组成部分。同样，当科学词汇和结构在宗教作品中缺失时，文本将倾向于倾向于精神或道德。前者是高度主观的，因此相对不重要，而后者表达的是控制的偏见，因此是限制性的。大白宫的主人[地球的精神等级制度。 编者注]并没有这个意思；他们只是缺乏词汇和理解。
 
 
鉴于上述情况，并考虑到许多业力一般都是通过人体来完成的，那么等级制度如何看待科学试图治疗癌症和其他由业力引起的疾病，不管是在子宫内还是其他地方？换句话说，业力如何通过其他物理手段（即身体可能会崩溃，就像克隆羊 "多莉 "一样）或在另一个层面上解决？
 
这个问题的答案在于自然选择法则。生活中有些情况（这就是其中之一）不是由更高的精神法则（本质上是业力）造成的，而是像重力这样的基本物理原则的结果。自然选择法则就是其中之一。当你通过医疗干预篡改遗传学时，你就是在篡改这一法则，你可以预期会有反作用。
另外，认为疾病是 "业力造成的 "是一个错误的假设。" 疾病是许多事情的产物，有时它与业力有关，但更多时候，它是一个更深层次的目的的产物：在这种情况下，是发现灵魂。如果没有疾病所要求的医疗技术，人类的灵魂将仍然是信仰的固定物，因此，它将在一个物种的子集中找到自己的方式，但不会像被科学证明存在时那样带有强大的重要性。
 
疾病对更广泛的物种来说是有作用的，尽管它在个人的背景下显得很荒谬。一个物种为对抗自身的死亡而发展的医疗技术，正是科学证明灵魂存在所需的技术基础。[The Grand Portal. Ed.]
 
 
SARS是一种生物武器，如果是的话，是谁开发和使用的？还是像其他流行病被深思熟虑的那样，是大众恐惧的结果？
 
SARS是生物多样性和有机物种融合的自然产物。它的爆发没有任何阴险之处，不可能通过更好的卫生来预防。
 
DK说在本世纪会有一个弟子出来继承布拉瓦茨基和贝利开创的第三批教义。这位弟子是否已经出现，这些教义是否正在由大师向弟子传播？这些教义是什么形式的，或者它们与之前的教义有很大不同吗？如果是这样，是哪位大师在做这件事（DK？），谁是弟子，或者他们居住在世界的哪个地方？
 
我现在无法对这个特定的问题作出评论。
 
帕坦伽利是WingMaker和Lyricus的成员吗？恕我直言，Master P中的字母P是指P（atanjali）吗？
 
帕坦伽利并不特别关注利瑞克斯。他与银河系这个区段的行星教学秩序有关。帕坦伽利的经文旨在使一个实体与整体性导航仪内灌输的统一振动保持一致。
不幸的是，它们被大多数入门者应用于其他目的（如精神控制），在这种错误的应用中，它们固有的力量被削弱了。
 
帕坦伽利在地球上的存在由于他的外星出身而被掩盖了。他是那个时代先进的思想家和学者，很少有人能理解他关于将整体性导航仪的振动与人类工具同步的真正教义。[帕坦伽利是印度教哲学家，他创造了一系列描述与心灵有关的瑜伽形式的经文。这通常被称为拉贾瑜伽。编者按】。］
 
我现在无法回答你关于P大师的问题。[P大师在爱丽丝-贝利和Djwhal Khul（DK）的书中被提及。编者按】。］
 
在《乌兰图亚之书》中，有几个参考资料似乎被WingMakers的材料所证实。一个例子是地球的行星参考编号。(这个数字可以在第一源泉光盘中找到。)另外，《小天书》中所描述的宇宙结构在某些方面与WingMakers的资料相似。乌兰图亚之书是如何被纳入WingMakers的材料的？
 
Urantia书是一个支流区。它与七个支流区中的一个没有关系，因为这些支流区是经过编码的感官数据流，而《乌兰图》是没有编码的纯文本。尽管如此，它还是属于问题十七中谈到的第二阶段的支流区的集合。[见《基督：使命与工作》，编者注）。
Urantia书与Lyricus的宇宙科学学科最为接近，但它并非由Lyricus撰写或创作。它主要来自于跨维度的来源--相当于一个基于地球的教学组织，只是来自不同的行星系统。有时行星系统会交换重要的著作或启示性的作品，以达到流通哲学思想或重要启示的目的。这部作品就是这样一个例子。
 
 
在这之后，有人问为什么WingMakers的材料中有这么多Urantia的材料。我回答说，有些宇宙学适合，但是，用我自己的话说，"詹姆斯把来自不同来源的材料混在一起。例如，在弗兰克-赫伯特的《沙丘》一书中发现了查科布萨。"我自己对此也很好奇，并承认《乌兰图亚之书》并没有引起我的共鸣。它的部分内容相当吸引人，而其他部分则是狭隘的、简单化的。例如，恕我直言，虽然我大体上理解七个超级宇宙和大宇宙等概念，但其图表和解释似乎很幼稚。(正如《第一源泉》光盘上所描绘的那样。编者注)例如，大多数研究过《宇宙之火论》的人都会认为，用乌兰图雅模型表达的WM宇宙学相比之下要差一些。我并不是说其他人或我完全理解TCF，而是说它所传达的观点远比迄今为止基于乌兰图亚至少部分的WM概念的简单表述更复杂。(《宇宙之火论》于1925年出版。藏族老师卓玛-库尔（Djwhal Khul）以心灵感应的方式将其传给爱丽丝-A-贝利。这是一本关于宇宙学和其他形而上学主题的深奥的书。编者注）。
 
这是一个有趣的话题。首先，你假设WingMakers的材料是基于《乌兰图亚书》，这并不准确。在这个星系中，《天书》中提出的宇宙学被认为是对大宇宙结构的两种最佳描述之一。(古箭计划中提到的那本书，《极限宇宙论》，被认为是另一本。)碰巧的是，WingMakers的材料并不是基于这种描述，而是基于物理大宇宙的现实，这恰好与《乌兰图雅书》所持的观点相吻合。我坚持认为，AAB的作品在对物理宇宙的宇宙学结构的描述方面，比不上《乌兰图亚书》或《极限宇宙论》。
宇宙之火论》更关注宏观世界和微观世界的定义，因为它们涉及到多元宇宙的狭窄视野。它对大宇宙的宇宙学结构的洞察力和由此产生的表述是不扎实的，它对东方神秘术语的大量使用为西方人的思维提供了障碍，而这是《尤兰蒂亚书》所不具备的。这并不是对《宇宙之火》的批评，但这是《尤兰蒂亚书》的读者群比《宇宙之火论》更广泛的原因之一。
 
关于目前WingMakers材料中包含的宇宙学的简单方法，这样做有几个原因。首先，这些材料的目的不是教授物理大宇宙的宇宙学，或被称为多元宇宙或多维现实的微妙振动领域。还有一些书将会做到这一点。WingMakers的材料是为了激励新化身的人达到他们在世的目的--发现大门户。它是许多将产生这种影响的作品之一。它是一个路标，而不是一部知识的百科全书。它是一种催化剂，而不是精神或宇宙学信息的阐述。
 
许多人谈到了2012年对人类的意义。2012年背后的真相是什么？
要明白一点，意义是一个相对的术语。例如，对我来说，意义是由人类接近发现大门户的程度来衡量的。因此，用我的标准，2012年不是一个特别重要的年份。然而，如果有人更关注物理环境，2012年可能确实有一些重大事件。[见 "能量之心：它在人类命运中的目的"。］
