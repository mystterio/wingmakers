Is there another word besides “Hierarchy” which I can use which is more akin to its true nature?
 
I like the concept of “Source Organizational Alignment” or SOA. It means that the source of an organization is rightfully empowered to establish a vision for the group energy to achieve. All who invest their time and energy in the organization have a responsibility to align to this vision. SOA is an alternative definition of Hierarchy that suggests its true nature.
That said, however, the difficulty emerges as Hierarchies protect the vision of their source when three things occur:
 
• The source vision was time-bound for a period of one generation, and the organization outlasts the source vision.
 
• The source was not truly visionary or adept at forecasting human behavioral shifts based on environmental changes.
 
• Substantial threats or opportunities emerge that impinge on the vision and necessitate its modification.
 
Bear in mind that the Grand Universe, while being near infinite in its spatial dimension, is infinitesimally sparse in terms of humanoid populations. Because of this condition, human populations learn how to interact across the spatial dimensions of space through the use of SIN [see glossary, Sovereign Integral Network]. Trading is the most common reason that humanoid populations interact; the second most common is to form alliances of safety.
 
Trade Alliance Organizations (TAO) [This sub-heading continues the above description of SOAs. Ed.]
 
These are the two most sweeping forms of SOAs within the physical, Grand Universe. There are very sophisticated and far-reaching trading networks, or what are sometimes called (this is a loose translation) Trade Alliance Organizations (TAO). These particular examples of SOAs form the very basis of the Hierarchy as it extends into the life-bearing planets that have become activated on the Sovereign Integral Network.
 
There are also planets whose populations have achieved a certain level of spiritual depth and awareness that causes them to abstain from the use of humanoid SOAs and participation within the TAOs. These are the most evolutionary advanced humanoid populations, and generally they prefer to remain outside of the conflicts that naturally arise from humanoid SOAs and TAOs. These populations invest their time and energy into manifesting a SOA of First Source and helping other planets in their evolutionary trajectory.
 
It is within these planets that Lyricus establishes an outpost. This outpost carries the seed vision of a SOA, but one that is aligned to the vision of First Source. Among these planets is a form of communication and organization, which could be referred to as a SOA or Hierarchy, but this is not the Hierarchy of which you have formed a mental picture.
 
Are you saying that earth’s Hierarchy is not an SOA, which is “aligned to the vision of First Source”? Or are you saying that my mental picture is not accurate enough to realize the true nature of earth’s SOA which is indeed aligned with First Source?
 
Earth’s SOA was established before the great flood by members of Lyricus that became known as the Elohim, or Shining Ones. These beings established seven centers of learning upon earth. These were instructional environments that accelerated the connection of the human instrument to the Wholeness Navigator, and enabled human initiates to ascend in consciousness such that it was possible to create the great philosophical systems that to some extent endure to this day.
The Hierarchy (as you define it) was the seed that was planted by the Lyricus team that worked with the human tribes of earth. In the span of one thousand years the human mind evolved dramatically, and with it, technologies emerged that were amazingly sophisticated. Most of these technologies were employed for the purpose of spiritual evolution of the species, however, as is always the case in a free will universe, not all of the human tribes could resist the psychic and mental manipulations of political leaders who saw the conquest of land resources more desirable than the development of spiritually evolved societies.
 
The Hierarchy’s SOA began to shift as a result with a higher priority placed on self-preservation. Its spiritual values and goals came under attack, and it was forced to recede underground. In part, because of this schism, the great flood exercised a new calculus on the human genome, and effectively began a new species. The Hierarchy took this learning to heart, and patience became a more desirable expression of its macro-personality. Its teachers became more visionary about the long pathway that stood before humankind.
 
A critic believes WingMakers is an elaborate hoax. He cannot accept the idea that a being (James) can work on earth within the spiritual Hierarchy, yet claim to come from another galaxy. He pointed out that DK (Djwhal Khul) only taught an order of Lives within our own galaxy, implying that extra-galactic contact was way out of proportion to the chain of hierarchical contacts possible to Earth humans.
 
One of the interesting observations I have made about the human mind is how someone who is revered as an authority can unintentionally define the borders of belief so resolutely for their followers. DK never reported that there was not an extension of the Hierarchy beyond the borders of the Milky Way galaxy, and that this grander order did not impact on, or influence, a local system.
 
It may surprise you to learn that DK (during the time of his transmissions to AAB) was not aware of these extra-galactic contacts of the Lyricus and seventh universe central race other than by myth. So, by his omission, it is assumed that he was of the opinion they did not exist. He simply didn’t know about Lyricus because it was outside of his mission objectives. His work required more focus, and when you open up this “can of worms” (Grand Multiverse Hierarchy) you need to assemble a team to disclose this information because it is too broad and deep for one personality to attempt to disclose (hence the nature of authorship of The Urantia Book).
 
Limitations of Metaphysical Writings [This sub-heading is a continuation of the above question and answer. Ed.]
 
The object in the lower right-hand section of the diagram that bears a resemblance to an antenna represents the knowledge base of humanity in its current view of the Grand Multiverse. Lamentably, it is overstated because it is impossible for me to depict a thin enough line and still make it visible. Suffice to say that The Urantia Book comes closer to depicting the horizontal view of the Grand Physical Universe, and the AAB materials comes closer to depicting the vertical view of the multiverse. Nonetheless, you can see that the “antenna” is only scratching the surface of the Grand Multiverse.
 
How can one person depict this breadth and depth of the infinite and expanding multiverse? They cannot, and if it is tried, they will do it a terrible injustice and their results will be misleading. Now, the universe and multiverse that DK depicted was contained well within the “antenna”. It wasn’t his objective to depict the grandest vision of the multiverse. It was his interest to depict the local system’s energy fields and its hierarchy, as he understood it.
 
[In order to maintain the continuity of the topical arrangement I have removed three paragraphs of this answer and placed them within the “Lyricus Teaching Order” section. Ed.]
 
But as I said before, DK was not aware of Lyricus at the time of his transmissions to AAB. Yes, he knew that the Hierarchy extended beyond his (and the Great White Lodge’s) mental construct, but he didn’t know how far, or for what purpose. The discovery of the Grand Portal has never been disclosed in any of the materials of the earth-based religious quarter. Given that this is the singular focus of Lyricus and humanity, doesn’t it strike you as peculiar?
 
This glaring omission from the religious quarter of humanity is a reflection of how the religions of earth object to, and/or misunderstand, the advance of science and technology. For example, DK never transmitted science in the context of genetics, and yet, within Lyricus, this is the nucleus knowledge. For DK, science was the consort of Antahkarana, triangles, or invocation (to name a few examples). It was not the science of the double helix. His conscious mind did not possess this vocabulary or knowledge, and therefore there was no way for him to speak directly to these topics.
 
[Antahkarana is a Sanskrit term that means the building of a bridge in consciousness between the everyday concrete thinking mind and the abstract spiritual mind, or what James refers to as higher mind. Ed.]
 
What is the progress of the externalisation of the Hierarchy? Who and what Masters are working “amongst Humanity” at this point?
 
The vision of the Hierarchy, as transmitted by Alice Bailey, was incomplete, as it did not include Lyricus and the Tribe of Light that encircles the Great Central Sun (to name two exclusions). This was an intentional oversight designed to simplify and localize the Hierarchical mission.
In terms of the externalization of the Hierarchy, it varies by planet/species. There are approximately thirty trillion potential life-bearing planets in superuniverse seven. Soul Carrier DNA is distributed on approximately .0015 percent of these planets, or about 4.5 billion planets. Can you imagine the scale of such an enterprise? Of these, the Hierarchy is externalized in a very small percentage—less than 1 percent, or about forty million planets, comprising some 840,000 different species.
 
As you can see, externalization, from the view of the Hierarchy is a process that encompasses a much larger scale than terra-earth. As it pertains to your question, all earth representatives from the White Lodge are working among humanity. I assume what you really mean is which known masters are physically incarnate at this time.
 
[The externalization of the Hierarchy is a major factor in the AAB/DK teachings. To date, James never directly links the Lyricus/WingMakers’ materials with the externalization process described by Djwhal Khul. In fact, James never referred to this event as the “externalization of the Hierarchy” until asked by individuals oriented to the AAB/DK teachings. However, there are hints within the material indicating that the Lyricus mission initiated by James in the form of the WingMakers’ website (1998) and later by the Lyricus website (2004) do, in fact, represent the initial stage of the externalization of the Hierarchy.
 
[In WingMakers’ Philosophy, Chamber Four “Beliefs and Their Energy Systems,” James appears to describe the “externalization” as the “Return of the Masters.” As can be seen here, James freely discusses this topic as a natural extension of the work and mission of Lyricus to earth. Also see the section, Christ’s Return to Earth. Ed.]
 
Number of Masters in the World [This sub-heading is a continuation of the above answer. Ed.]
 
I am not at liberty to disclose this list. I will tell you that there are approximately 165 masters (sixth [degree] initiates and above) who are physically present on terra-earth, and who operate as the vanguard of the spiritual corps, mostly through ashramic activities. There are some masters who have ventured outside of the relative anonymity and protection of the ashram, but these number less than a dozen, and apart from one name, you would not recognize them in the literature of Alice Bailey or others associated with the White Lodge.
 
Avatar of Synthesis [This sub-heading is a continuation of the above answer. Ed.]The Avatar of Synthesis is instructed through Lyricus and, as you know, operates in conjunction and coordination with Christ. The Avatar of Synthesis is intimately involved in the Lyricus objectives, knowing that the Grand Portal and the return of Christ Consciousness galvanize and make durable the One Humanity and One World consciousness.
 
[The fact that James specifically mentions the Avatar of Synthesis is significant because it indicates his detailed knowledge of a specific term originally published in the Alice A. Bailey books of esoteric philosophy.
 
The AAB works mention various orders of avatars. The term “avatar” is Sanskrit and generally means a messenger from a higher world who visits a “lower” world in order to give spiritual guidance. The Avatar of Synthesis is identified as a cosmic avatar and therefore comes from somewhere outside our solar system. Ed.]
 
Is the Hierarchy concerned about the imminent use of nuclear weapons? Would they allow them to be used in some circumstances?
 
There is not a singular opinion on this matter inside the Hierarchy. Regardless of the intervention strategies of the Hierarchy, this universe is founded on the principle of free will. Interventions are weighed very, very carefully—both in and out of time sequence, and are rarely exercised unless they significantly countermand a major objective of the Hierarchy like the discovery of the Grand Portal.
 
Who was Jesus Christ in relation to the WingMakers?
 
For those of you who will read these words, and are steeped in Christianity, forgive the manner of my response. I am not a man who communicates delicately when speaking my truth.
Jesus incarnated not for the purpose of begetting a religion. He simply expressed his vision of the spiritual dimensions, making First Source accessible and singular. His fellow humans were so eager for the fulfillment of prophecy that they imposed upon him the mantle of Messiah, which he hesitantly agreed to shoulder.
 
Jesus presently serves a leadership role in the teaching organization of which I spok earlier, which is made up of authentic spiritual leaders of earth. [James is referring to the Hierarchy. Ed.]
 
He is very much aware of both the WingMakers and Lyricus. An interesting footnote: While the religious organizations compete for human membership, those teachers who are responsible for the religions’ origin, operate in collaboration and cooperation beneath the same, bold banner—human evolution.
 
Those teachers who have translated from the physical to the interdimensional realms remain powerful teachers of humanity. They shift their focus from individualistic missions to collaborative missions, and in this spirit of collaboration, become increasingly powerful as change agents for the human condition. Jesus, in particular, operates as a managing director of the teaching organization [the Hierarchy], and in this role, interfaces with Lyricus on planning and analysis of the Grand Portal.
 
There is a common understanding among the teaching core that the confluence of science, art, and religion is inevitable, and it will culminate in the scientific discovery of the human soul, and more specifically, how the human soul is designed. Much like the physical body has a human genome, the spiritual body, or Wholeness Navigator, has a spiritual genome. And this genome is far more important to understand than the human because it is the causal element, while the human genome is the receptor.
 
There are six components to this effort that are coordinated:
 
1. Lyricus designs, transposes, and installs galactic Tributary Zones to a planetary system.
 
2. Earth teachers (non-physical) prepare the species for acceptance of the Grand Portal.
 
3. Earth teachers (physical) discover the way to the Grand Portal via the Tributary Zones.
 
4. Earth teachers (physical) disseminate and preserve the knowledge of the Grand Portal.
 
5. Earth teachers (physical and non-physical) unite humanity to the Sovereign Integral Network.
 
6. Source Intelligence and Lyricus facilitate the process throughout the Grand Universe.
 
Jesus’ role is of high importance in stage two, and in approximately eighty years, in stage five. He essentially leads this process with the collaborative assistance of the entire teaching organization of ascended (non-physical) teachers. [First published July 9, 2001. Ed.]
 
The return of the Christ was originally slated as around 2025. Has that date been brought forward some, and if so, what is the approximate timing now?
 
[Although the return of Jesus Christ is commonly associated with many Christian denominations, this religious belief also plays a central part in the spiritual philosophy of the Alice Bailey/DK books. This belief is quite different from the standard Christian viewpoint. In the Bailey/DK scenario, the Christ returns to the world more in line with Eastern belief of an avatar, or messenger from the spiritual world, rather than as a savior, or messiah. Such a return does not endorse any specific religion. Additionally, no specific date is given for such an event, because, according to the scenario, it is determined by the spiritual growth and maturity of the humanity. Ed.]
The timing for the return of the Christ is related to the timing of the emergence of the Church Invisible. The two are inseparable. In the Lyricus vocabulary, the Church Invisible is the emergence of the Grand Portal and its preeminence as the unification platform of legacy religions and faith-based belief systems. The Christ Consciousness will only prepare the Church Invisible to reign within the human heart and higher mind, and Christ will, in effect, ascend in evolutionary service thereafter.
 
In regard to your question about timing, it is impossible to place specific time measures to events that involve complex human decisions. It is truly, in the end, a human decision, not one imposed by the Hierarchy.
 
How is the WingMakers’ project and the other five or six projects related to the reappearance of the Christ or World Teacher?
 
The Hierarchy—not the Christed One—will emerge first, and they will concentrate on bringing the new psychology and metaphysics to the twenty-first century.
The WingMakers’ teachings are one of the first stages of this externalization process, which consists of transmitting the catalytic forces of the Tributary Zones to the communication networks of the world population.
 
The Christed One is an energy field that accompanies these teachings and those individuals that immerse within the Tributary Zones with the intention of accelerating their consciousness for the purpose of discovering the Grand Portal.
 
The Christed One will not return, so much as become acknowledged in the post-discovery period of the Grand Portal. This is the consciousness-shift of the planet and the human species. A specific set of technologies will make possible the acknowledgment of Christ, which has been referred to as the Return of the Masters. In reality, the world teacher will be the Grand Portal.
 
From your knowledge of cosmogony/cosmology, are we to expect an “Antichrist” in the near future? If so, what will be the nature of the Anti-Christ? Do we mean a person, a thought pattern, an attitude, an alien, Animus, a country etc.?
 
The concept of an antichrist is deeply penetrating as a mythology and prophecy. It is a very complex subject, and one that I lack sufficient time to properly address. In order to understand the Antichrist, you must first understand the Christ, and this is where most definitions or predictions of the antichrist fail.
Christ, non-personalized, is human salvation from the grips of a repressive energy system that places human beings in a survival mode of consciousness. Christ is the Grand Portal.
 
The Antichrist, therefore, is represented as a collection of forces that resist the discovery of the Grand Portal for fear of the changes it will bring. Ironically, these forces will be largely generated from religious centers, and consequently, governments, in many instances, will be forced to follow.
 
If I were to say that the Antichrist is organized religion, it would be too general a statement. I can only tell you that the powers behind humanity’s major religious organizations will eventually unite and resist this discovery with all their strength. This has been foreshadowed in many prophecies, but the religious authorities have been loath to share it. It is not commonly understood in religious circles, but the major power centers of religious activity on earth each possess an inner circle of authority, and these individuals are at least dimly aware of these prophecies, and in one instance, are crystal clear about what the future holds in the twenty-first century.
 
It is my understanding that each universe was created one at a time, drawing on the knowledge gained from the previous universes. If this is so, then does our future hold an eighth (or more) universe?
 
It is certainly a possibility, but I cannot say with any certainty that this will occur or is part of the divine plan. I have to answer, “I do not know”.
 
In the myths of our culture, are there references to the other six universes?
 
No. The singularity of the physical universe is one of the most pervasive and persistent myths affecting all cultures throughout time. The seven universes are sometimes confused with the inner dimensions of consciousness, but these inner dimensions correspond to the physical universe—hence, each universe consists of outer and inner dimensions, and these multiple dimensions are most potent where the greatest concentrations of life forms exist.
For example, the inner dimensions of Earth are far more developed and multi-faceted than those that exist around Jupiter, despite the fact that Jupiter is precisely 10.7 times larger than Earth. The concentration of life forms and the accessibility of these life forms to the Genetic Mind, Source Intelligence, and Entity Consciousness create this interwoven, multidimensional matrix of worlds. When multiplicity, or “worlds,” “planes,” or “realms” is depicted in myth or even modern day descriptions, they are referencing these inner dimensions, and not the seven universes of the physical Grand Universe.
 
Do the myths of our culture also reference the beings from other universes or just our own? For instance are angels from another universe?
 
The physical instruments of sentient life forms of the other six universes do not cross over into our universe, or vice versa. The seven universes are isolated vibrationally (spatially) and genetically (bio-structurally). This helps to ensure that the evolutionary pathways of a species in one universe do not collide or conflict with another. It enables diversity. It enables near-infinite evolutionary extension. While the physical instrument cannot cross over, the individuated consciousness can. And to this degree there are some beings that “migrate” from one universe to another. This is not analogous to the ascension process.
Regarding your question about angels, angelic beings are not from outside universe seven (our universe). Indeed, neither are they from outside our galaxy.
 
Are you anti-Zeta Reticuli and The Galactic Federation, should they exist?
 
I am not. And they do exist. That’s the short answer.
As for the Zeta Reticuli, they are like all complex, humanoid species; they have multiplicity in their behaviors. There is no single personality that defines the species. Some factions or sub-cultures of the Zeta Reticuli are unpleasant by human standards, and yet they have their reasons for their behaviors, which I understand. Because I understand them, I can faithfully report that while I don’t support or honor their behavior, I am not against them as an enemy. I simply withdraw my support and openly acknowledge this among those I associate with.
 
Regarding the Galactic Federation, this is a form of hierarchical command and control, and while I honor its mission and support its purpose, I personally am not bound to its rule nor am I subject to its hierarchical structure. I do, however, respect the opinions of the Galactic Federation and would carefully weigh their suggestions to the extent they impacted on my personal mission.
 
[Note that the section on Source Organizational Alignment (SOA) states that hierarchical orders such as the Galactic Federation exist. Hierarchical pantheons of gods recorded by ancient civilizations such as the Sumerian, Egyptian, and Hindu, to name a few, may be earthly reflections of cosmic SOAs such as the Galactic Federation. This is indicated further by James’ comments in the SOA section in regard to earth’s Hierarchy of master teachers. Ed.]
 
When will we see ET’s openly walking around on the earth and mixing with earth humans? Assuming of course that official ET government disclosure occurs first? What role will the WingMakers play in these events?
 
Forgive me if I engage in recreation with your question just a bit. Everywhere you are there are extraterrestrials. It’s a well-known fact of your scientists that the atomic structure of the human form is derived from particles of stars. Thus, the human instrument is essentially extraterrestrial.
Set this aside for a moment. What animates the human instrument? What is ensouled within the body? Isn’t it a consciousness of understanding, borne of the archetype of souls known as First Source? Is this not of extraterrestrial origin? Both the animating force and the bodies within which this force expresses are not of this earth. What you call humans, we call Sovereign Entities of the Central Universe (SECU—pronounced SeeQue).
 
SECUs are the alpha and omega. They are not time-bound nor restrained by the adornments of bodies. They are the primal form finished and honed to the perfection of their creator, and in this, we are all the same.
 
Now, to your point, extraterrestrials are walking around on earth, you just don’t recognize them as extraterrestrials because the human genome and the genome of many extraterrestrial races are essentially the same. There will be ETs of a different cast that will make their presence known in the next decade, but they will not interfere with the social order.
 
When the Grand Portal is unveiled by human hands you will invoke the attention of the Galactic Federation, and humanity will be invited to interact in the affairs of the galactic family. It is then that the diversity of the humanoid species will be appreciated, and it is precisely for this reason that humanity must come to understand itself as a SECU first, and human second.
 
What about ETs and ufo phenomena? I think that lots of this involves the devas of the ethers, but not all of it. And why would such a massive topic be obscured in esoteric teachings. If DK has mentioned it, then it is very well veiled. Most esoteric students are not integrating this ET phenomenon with the ageless wisdom and it seems to me that something of major importance is being missed here. I am interested in integrating these two areas and am giving a presentation to a ufo group in the Philadelphia area on May 4. I want to synthesize and bridge these areas if possible. (Devas (Sanskrit) are what the Christian world call angels. Devas play an important, but mysterious role in the expression of life in our galaxy. Angels are referred to in the third Neruda interview and very briefly in the fourth interview. Ed.)
 
The ET phenomenon is too complex for most people to address or digest. If you bring up one end of this conundrum, you are forced to admit that you don’t know the other. This applies equally to the media, science, politicians, military, military industrial complex, and religion. There is ample proof of extraterrestrial interaction on earth, but this proof is hard to guide into a single, comprehensible “corral” so that the public can understand the phenomenon without feeling hoodwinked or threatened. There are some who’re trying to do this (Dr. Greer), but they will be largely unsuccessful because the evidence is focused on the conspiratorial cover-up, and not on the ET agendas or long-range purpose.
To your point about devas, they are not confused with the ET and UFO phenomenon. Only on rare occasions do people make this error of identity. There is, however, a very sophisticated program of indoctrination being played out by both ETs and factions of our intelligence communities. These are responsible for the frequency of ET/UFO reports, as in the case of abductions. Bear in mind, that I am an ET by definition. In the broader view, we all are. We all stem from extraterrestrial origins. Some of us simply remember them better than others.
 
What is your relationship with other extraterrestrial races involved with the earth? Are the Animus real or fictional?
 
My relationships are with humans at the present. I do not have interactions with what I believe you are calling extraterrestrial races, other than my ancient bonds with Lyricus. As for the Animus, they are very real.
 
Is there an Animus influence in the hierarchy? If yes are their intentions designed to minimize the emergence of the SECUs?
 
There are tremendous variations of personality in the Animus as there is within humanity at large. There are factions within the Animus that desire nothing more than to become a soul carrier and live harmoniously with humanoids; and there are factions that would like to supplant the humanoid genome and rule over their worlds. With this backdrop, the answer to your question is a qualified “yes”. The emergence of the SECU functionality is a prime concern within certain Animus factions, as is the related discovery of the Grand Portal, for the simple reason that it connects humanity with the broader humanoid family present throughout universe seven. [The acronym “SECU” stands for “Sovereign Entity of the Central Universe.” Ed.]
 
How does the Hierarchy regard the present post-Iraq situation in terms of the ‘sealing of the door where evil dwells’? Has the Dark Brotherhood regained the power it had pre World War II, when it worked through the axis nations? Is the situation in terms of the balance of power between the White and Black Lodges regarded as precarious at the moment? Who currently has the upper hand?
 
[The dark lodge is a name given to a collective group of entities who seek to keep humanity imprisoned in the confines of pure materialism. Through their influence, humanity is kept in fear, separation, and spiritual darkness. Again, this term is used in the Bailey/Djwhal Khul philosophical texts, but appears as the “black lodge” or “dark brotherhood.” The White Lodge is a term equivalent to the Hierarchy of earth teachers. Ed.]
The Dark Lodge continues to consume and project power within the physical and emotional planes of terra-earth, irrespective of the external events of war. In other words, wars and political unrest are not barometers of the Dark Lodge. Rather, the signs of the Dark Lodge are found in the ethics of adults and children, and how, on a collective basis, these situational ethics re-direct the global culture away from the divine will-to-good. [Note that James’ employment of the term “will-to-good” is part of the Alice Bailey/DK lexicon. Here, James is indicating his knowledge of this lexicon. Ed.]
 
Until the Wholeness Navigator (a component of the human soul) is discovered and its practical applications are employed by a critical mass of humans, the Dark Lodge will dominate in this physical realm. Their domination is enabled by the human species that lack identification with the unification force that the Wholeness Navigator anchors within the higher mind. This feeling of separation from the brotherhood of souls is the singular weapon exploited by the Dark Lodge to recruit, retain, and motivate its followers.

Is the conspiracy theory correct that the U.S. government and/or the Israeli secret service engineered the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11? What was the degree of complicity in the operation by Osama Bin Laden?
 
No one engineered the 9/11 tragedies, other than those who carried it out. The Dark Lodge did not orchestrate it. It is a natural, organic event arising out of the disconnected, disenfranchised populations of the world as they strive to strike back at what they deem cultural genocide.
Cultural genocide (I’m making a distinction between racial genocide) is one of the more subtle ways to displace indigenous control of the resources in the Middle East. One could argue that the Dark Lodge or the U.S. government knew that something like 9/11 could occur, but they did not prescribe the method of destruction, nor did they enable it specifically. Rather, they project their power and the cultural autocracy associated with it, knowing a reaction is inevitable.
 
To every unchecked power, there is a resistance movement. It is a law of the universe, and the Dark Lodge is very well aware of it. However, the resistance movement can be manipulated to invoke fear, and it is this fear that further degrades situational ethics, opening the door to involution.
 
 
Are Osama Bin Laden or George Bush disciples, and if so what is their evolutionary status, First to Second degree (1.3, 1.5 etc.)?
 
[This questioner is using the Theosophical lexicon when referring to disciples and degrees of initiation. In this context, disciples are students following an accelerated path of training in spiritual development. This process can be conscious or unconscious. During the “unconscious” phase of this developmental path, an individual may be experiencing a particular lifetime in which he or she is engaged in an accelerated learning and testing period. In the context of Theosophy, initiation degrees are developmental levels of spiritual growth and achievement based on life experience gained in the framework of one’s chosen spiritual path. Ed.]
Regarding levels of discipleship or evolutionary status, this is a very personal matter and is never disclosed by Lyricus teachers. Furthermore, any undue emphasis on initiation status, particularly unrelated to your own, is misdirected energy.
 
In light of the recent tragedy (September 11) how do we recover some perception into the big picture and place these events of terrorism in perspective?
 
The world is fragmented into religious and political perspectives that land on various points of an expanding continuum. This fragmentation is the expression of humanity’s collective ignorance of the Wholeness Navigator, or immortal essence. It is this ignorance, and this ignorance alone, that perceptually separates you not only from First Source, or God, but also those of your human family and the broader community of life forms that extend throughout the Grand Universe.
This specific condition of ignorance creates the duality of good and evil and its reliable shadow of sin. As depicted so admirably in the media, the enemy of the United States, and indeed the free world at large, has been sculpted into an unrevealed network of terrorists who personify evil, while we, the free world, stand erect as the embodiment of good. I invite you to contemplate the vulnerability of this paradigm.
 
The conceptual structure of humanity’s success does not lie in the simplistic notion of the triumph of good over evil. Instead, it lies in the investment of scientific and technical resources, coupled to the self-reliant ingenuity of the human race to discover the Wholeness Navigator and share this discovery with the world’s population. This will not be done with the full cooperation of the human race. Indeed, it never is. There is always the dampening effect of those who fear the changes that will follow in the wake of this vital discovery.
 
The terrorist network is a facet of this dampening effect that will assail all efforts to unify humanity, and it will not be the only form of resistance. As humanity enters into the unfolding of its next three generations, this network will test it repeatedly, and at times, as witnessed this week, with brutal effectiveness. Ironically, terrorism fulfills the very role it eschews inasmuch as the common enemy unifies.
 
Those elements of the population, whether they are countries like North Korea and Iraq, or radical religious factions, have one thing in common: they dread unification of the world’s people because they fear that their unique ethnicity, culture, and religious customs will be extinguished, while those populations who strive for unification believe their cultures will be a foundation stone in the new, global society. This is a fundamental anxiety of our time.
 
Once a world’s population reaches a stage of global communication, those nations who can apply the global communications platform naturally seek a conceptual structure that unifies the population, first economically, and then, militarily. Earth is well underway in both arenas, but the dampening effect of the terrorist network is what will help to temper the will of the population to unify. Once this unification is established, the population will be better able to collaborate and share, and this is precisely what the scientific discovery of the Wholeness Navigator requires.
 
It is completely rational to be outraged by the brutality of these recent attacks; it is also sensible to understand them in the broader context. Our political, military, and media leaders do not share this perspective, not because they lack sensibility, but because their systems of reference are designed to protect what has been established by previous generations as our self-interest, rather than to understand the broader context as it relates to the vital discoveries that lie ahead.
 
I know in the minds of each of you lies the gnawing question: Where will this invasive terrorism lead and how far will it go? Will it lead to a world war? Will the world economy weaken as a result? I can answer yes to the last two questions, but it will not overtake the world’s progression to unify, but rather hasten its realization. While sacrifices will be required, it will generate a new sense of collective purpose and connection among the nations and tribes of earth.
 
If you remain absorbed in the media-defined expression of this dramatic story as it ensues, you may be entrained to think and act as our leaders do, which is centered on the protection of the self-interests of the free world. You may instead choose to rely more on the leadership of your inmost self during the times that will come, and place the events in the broader context of the journey that lies ahead—both for you as an individual and humanity as a whole.
 
Each of you must feel as though you have walked unwittingly through a gate, and, having seen what’s on the other side, you want to return from whence you came, but the gate locked behind you. We have entered a new world where your vulnerability has been drawn in sharp relief. What lies ahead is not of our conscious designs, but rather it is an expression of our accumulated self-interests and general ignorance of the Wholeness Navigator, and subconsciously, there are few on earth who do not realize this.
 
There is no one to blame for this condition. It is an evolutionary element of the long process for a humanoid species to achieve the scientific discovery of the higher dimensions from which humanity is woven. Upon this journey humankind has struggled before, but it has always found its way forward to its ultimate goal, and it is this goal—subtle as it may be—that seeks to articulate itself in the hearts and minds of all of you who are incarnate at this time.
 
There will be new tests that will assail humanity throughout the twenty-first century; some will be more profoundly shattering than those witnessed this week. Invariably, your leaders will draw a line between good and evil and seek to eradicate the evil, and in every instance the target will only extend further into the deep recesses of obscurity and de-centralization.
 
There is a strategic plan for all life-bearing planets, and this plan is not established at the outset and then cast aside. It is constantly undergoing refinement and adjustment. The only stability in this plan is the ultimate goal; the journey itself weaves, stalls, accelerates, and sometimes even reverses in direction. There is, however, the guiding hand of First Source that never releases, nor turns away in indifference, and this same hand touches into the deepest part of you—especially in times such as these, and it proffers insight.
 
My message to each of you is to listen to this insight in the quiet of the night or morning, in the natural ways of the sky, the ocean, the woods, or fields, and invite it to reveal the emotional intelligence that survives the physical body. Allow this to prevail in your heart and mind even amid the unsettling times of today and the future. When you capture this insight, anchor it in your life by expressing it through your senses of touch, sight, hearing, and sound. You can think of this as the Reassurance Vibration. It is the vibration you will want to carry inside of you and share.
 
The Zionists were a tool of the Dark Brotherhood pre and post WWII: “The “sealing” of that door had not been successfully accomplished, and it is the part of wisdom to discover this in time. These Forces of Evil work through a triangle of evil, one point of which is to be found in the Zionist Movement in the United States, another in central Europe, and the third in Palestine. Palestine is no longer a Holy Land and should not be so regarded.” Is this triangle still activated through the ‘Neocons’ in the American administration? If so, how dangerous is their agenda in terms of Middle East domination by America in Israel?
 
Your question has underlying assumptions that are not entirely accurate, and therefore if I were to answer it directly, my answer would, by necessity, be obtuse.
Let me just say that Palestine and Israel are minor elements in the grand scheme of the Dark Lodge. They are like misdirection tools in the hands of a magician. Where you have concentration of control of earth’s vital resources (i.e., oil, natural gas, water, food commodities, gold, diamonds, etc.) that is where you will find the Dark Lodge operating. Using this line of reasoning, neither Israel nor Palestine possesses these vital resources.
These resources are the lifeblood of the Dark Lodge as well as the powerbase upon which they rise to prominence and exercise their greed. It has been this way for hundreds upon hundreds of generations. This is as true for terra-earth as it is any life-bearing planet with soul carrier DNA pre-Grand Portal time.
 
A planet’s vital and valuable resources attract those who identify with power instead of brotherhood; exploitation instead of collaboration. This is the very basis of the Dark Lodge.
 
How imminent does the Hierarchy regard the resolution of the Israeli/Palestinian crisis? Is the Manu considering drastic measures be taken if the situation is not resolved soon?
 
The resolution of the crisis in the Middle East is all interconnected. The Israeli/Palestinian conflict is fueled by a near-inexhaustible supply of mutual resentment, and it all goes to the issue of cultural genocide and the shifting of control of vital resources.
When the Native Americans underwent this process they initially had resistance movements, but eventually succumbed to the interminable force of the white expansionist movement. This will not be the case in this conflict. It will continue for many decades in cycles of ceasefires and hostile resumptions.
 
The Manu of the Fifth Race is not concerned with matters of this kind. If it were, it would not prepare for the next evolutionary standard of the soul carrier DNA. This is the vital task that consumes the Manu at present. [See fn. 2. Ed.]
 
Is there a worldwide economic recession imminent? Does the Hierarchy regard this as essential in order for there to be a new monetary system developed?
 
There is a Zen proverb: The last thing a fish notices is water. The recession is well underway, and it is global. It is a result of the Dark Lodge’s control of the money/asset/vital resources supply. The Hierarchy doesn’t concern itself about the monetary system as long as the technology required for the Grand Portal continues to receive investment (and it will).
 
"There’s a persistent memory in the psyche of humans—particularly the weaker cultures that have been trampled on by nations bent on colonization. These grievous indignations to the weaker nations of the world have left a deep mark on their collective memory. It’s vital that this memory be erased or purged in order for humankind to become unified in its governance and fundamental systems. This event can be orchestrated or it may occur through natural means, but it’s generally agreed that an event must arise that galvanizes the world’s people to unite, and in this process, purge the memory of all peoples, but especially those who have been dealt with as victims of colonization." (This quotation is taken from Neruda Interview Four. Ed.) By “purge” and “erase” what exactly do you mean? Kill off these cultures or find ways to heal their collective memory or something else?
 
Purge, in this context, means to release the memory of victimhood in favor of a vision to unite for a common cause and/or purpose, and to construct together rather than participate in the destructive cycles of revenge-sabotage. Again, the discovery of the Grand Portal is a galvanizing event/process of sufficient magnitude to shift these collective memories into release and create a new pattern of behavior, which is the only way that these changes can be sustained.
 
 
What is the relationship between the Montauk Project and the WingMakers (if there is any)?
 
I will give you a peek into what occurred that led to the Montauk Project.
A very bright man by the name of Vannevar Bush (no relation to GWB) headed up a small group of brilliant physicists who were working with the ACIO when it was newly formed.
 
Bush was the ostensible leader of this scientific force who was tasked to perform some reengineering feats of UFO technologies. These initial extraterrestrial technologies were purposely left for discovery as a means to accelerate the time of the networks (Internet being the first stage—SIN being the culmination stage). [See Sovereign Integral Network in glossary. Ed.]
 
The walls of secrecy are always permeable within the government and military, and Bush became known as a superior investigator of these technologies. This project was held in higher security than the Manhattan Project. However, because Bush was too visible and potentially a risk, this re-engineering project was funneled into the ACIO where Bush was given the opportunity to join.
 
He declined because of the need to essentially leave society and become anonymous. Bush, even at that time, was being groomed by the Central Race to help invent the stage one Network infrastructure, and he had a semi-conscious realization that his real mission was involved in this endeavor, and not the ACIO.
 
Fifteen was also being groomed for the position, but was considered less trustworthy as a person with whom the military and Incunabula could rely on to follow their own agenda. Nonetheless, Fifteen was considered a far brighter and more capable mind to initiate the sort of discoveries and fathom the potentials that these extraterrestrial technologies held.
 
During the time when Bush was leading the re-engineering efforts, he was asked to participate in the earliest experiments in time travel. Even Einstein was consulted for a short time on these experiments, which were conducted in absolute secrecy. The outcome, while unsuccessful, did generate an enthusiasm within the Incunabula (for all the obvious reasons); however, it was not given any additional funding by the military so the project was closed.
 
The project file ended up in Fifteen’s hands, and there were some elements that were found useful (dealing with transitory states of degaussing). A copy of the project file also ended up at Brookhaven. This copy later turned into the Montauk Project, but was quickly diverted into mind control experiments that went awry. The military really controlled Montauk, while the Incunabula controlled the ACIO (in the early years of its development).
 
Now, as for the credibility of these men and their association with the WingMakers, I will leave this to you. I will only add that the Central Race works through individuals in such a way that they do not know they are being worked with. Those who claim this communication do not generally have it.
 
If they have alignment to the Grand Portal it will be obvious in their deeds and words, even if they don’t know about the WingMakers or the intrinsic nature of the universe. I understand your lament that people miss the spiritual undercurrents and sometimes rush to the superficial eddies of conspiracy and cover-up. The two dramas are very different in nature, but they are not incompatible.
 
What are your views on chip implants for purposes of identification and law enforcement? Would you avoid or accept such an implant into your human instrument?
 
I would resist it with every ounce of my ability and legal recourse, but if the day arrived when it became a law and I was required to accept such an implant, I would begrudgingly accept it because it is a law, and it would only arrive as a law if there were some value in its proposition. An implant would not influence any of my behaviors, conduct, attitude or any other expression.
 
Do global events, such as warfare, famine, environmental issues etc. play any part in mankind’s discovery of the Grand Portal, or its move from the third to the fourth dimension?
 
It’s important to understand that humanity is achieving this discovery as a natural extension of its evolutionary course. Along this pathway are strewn the follies of an immature race, and these follies can prevent or restrain safe passage to the Grand Portal. But fortunately, evolution is not a single track of physical or mental capabilities arranged in an ever-increasing structure of competence and adaptive skills. Evolution is operating on thousands of micro-paths, and many of the most profound are invisible to the human senses.
The orientation that humanity is emerging from the relative darkness of the third dimension to the fourth dimension is a misconception of the modern-day New Age movement.
 
Humanity evolves to embrace the multiverse, and as it evolves it discovers that its superuniverse is accessible to the human mind in ways that defy logic. This is the stage upon which humanity is entering, and it is not to ascend in a vibratory epiphany to a higher dimension, but rather, it is to interact with a broader multiverse of intelligence that heretofore has only been imagined by a handful of humanity’s finest representatives.
 
Humanity will remain in the third dimension, but will increasingly become aware of the higher dimensions while living in the third dimension, even as First Source, its creator, does. First Source lives in the third dimension, but is simultaneously aware of itself throughout the spectrum of the multiverse, and through Source Intelligence, is aware of all life forms in all dimensions. Humanity will ultimately access this same perspective by applying the Grand Portal as a “lens” through which it can gain admission to First Source consciousness. First Source—in this specific example—is less God than the archetype of the Wholeness Navigator.
 
Advanced Incoming Souls [This answer was originally part of question 17-S3. For the first part see Initiates 17-S3A. Ed.]
 
Within the next three generations, an influx of advanced souls will be incarnating within terra-earth. We call this influx: Symmetry of Spheres. These advanced souls (most from outside this solar system) will be encoded with predispositions of transformation. By the year 2080, they will be over two hundred million strong. These are the transformers who will bring symmetry to the asymmetrical physical and emotional realms. It will be the leaders of this movement that will be responsible for the discovery and irrefutable proof of the human soul.
 
This is the climax of human achievement in this evolutionary cycle, and it is the undeniable goal of all within the White Lodge because this discovery is not personal. It is not sheltered in the sanctity of the individual’s realm of experience. It is the externalization of the Hierarchy, and it will touch every consciousness with its indelible mark.
 
The Christ Consciousness will anchor it and the Church Invisible will protect it from all who try to malign, suppress, or prevent this discovery.
 
In the Lyricus vocabulary, the Church Invisible is the emergence of the Grand Portal and its preeminence as the unification platform of legacy religions and belief systems.”

除了 "等级制度"，我是否可以使用另一个更接近其真实性质的词？
 
我喜欢 "源头组织调整 "或SOA的概念。这意味着，一个组织的源头理所当然地有权为团体的能量建立一个愿景来实现。所有在组织中投入时间和精力的人，都有责任向这个愿景看齐。SOA是等级制的另一种定义，表明其真正的性质。
不过，话虽如此，当发生三件事时，困难就出现了，因为Hierarchies保护其来源的愿景。
 
- 源头的愿景是有时间限制的，只有一代人的时间，而组织的时间超过了源头的愿景。
 
- 消息来源并非真正有远见，也不善于预测基于环境变化的人类行为转变。
 
- 出现了实质性的威胁或机会，影响了愿景，有必要对其进行修改。
 
请记住，大宇宙虽然在空间维度上接近无限，但在类人种群方面却无限稀少。由于这种情况，人类种群学会了如何通过使用SIN[见词汇表，主权积分网络]在空间维度上进行互动。交易是类人种群互动的最常见原因；第二大原因是形成安全联盟。
 
贸易联盟组织(TAO) [本小标题延续了上述对SOA的描述。 Ed.] 。
 
这是物理大宇宙中最广泛的两种形式的SOA。还有非常复杂和深远的贸易网络，或有时被称为（这是一个松散的翻译）贸易联盟组织（TAO）。这些特殊的SOA例子构成了等级制度的基础，因为它延伸到了在主权整体网络上被激活的有生命的星球。
 
还有一些星球上的居民已经达到了一定的精神深度和意识水平，导致他们放弃使用类人SOA和参与TAO。这些是进化程度最高的类人种群，通常他们更愿意置身于类人SOA和TAO自然产生的冲突之外。这些人群将他们的时间和精力投入到表现第一源的SOA和帮助其他星球的进化轨迹中。
 
Lyricus正是在这些星球上建立了一个前哨站。这个前哨站承载着SOA的种子愿景，但它与第一源的愿景相一致。在这些星球中，有一种沟通和组织形式，可以被称为SOA或等级制度，但这并不是你所形成的等级制度的心理图景。
 
你是说地球上的等级制度不是一个 "与第一源泉的愿景一致 "的SOA？或者你是说，我的心理图景不够准确，无法认识到地球上确实与第一源头一致的SOA的真实性质？
 
地球上的SOA是在大洪水之前由Lyricus的成员建立的，他们被称为Elohim或Shining Ones。这些生命在地球上建立了七个学习中心。这些教学环境加速了人类工具与整体导航仪的连接，并使人类入门者的意识得到提升，从而有可能创造出伟大的哲学体系，在某种程度上延续到今天。
等级制度（如你所定义的）是由与地球上的人类部落合作的Lyricus团队播下的种子。在一千年的时间里，人类的思想发生了巨大的变化，随之而来的是令人惊讶的复杂技术的出现。这些技术大多是为了物种的精神进化而采用的，然而，正如自由意志宇宙中的情况一样，并非所有的人类部落都能抵制政治领导人的精神和心理操纵，他们认为征服土地资源比发展精神上的进化社会更可取。
 
等级制度的SOA因此开始转变，更加重视自我保护。它的精神价值和目标受到了攻击，它被迫退到地下。在某种程度上，由于这种分裂，大洪水对人类的基因组进行了新的计算，并有效地开始了一个新的物种。等级制度将这一学习铭记于心，耐心成为其宏观人格的一个更理想的表达。它的教师对摆在人类面前的漫长道路变得更加有远见。
 
一位评论家认为WingMakers是一个精心策划的骗局。他不能接受这样的观点：一个人（詹姆斯）可以在地球上的精神层次中工作，却声称来自另一个星系。他指出DK（Djwhal Khul）只在我们自己的星系内教授了一个生命序列，这意味着银河系外的接触与地球人类可能的等级接触链相比，是远远不成比例的。
 
我对人类思维的一个有趣的观察是，一个被尊为权威的人如何无意中为他们的追随者如此坚决地界定信仰的边界。DK从来没有报告说，在银河系的边界之外没有等级制度的延伸，而且这个更宏大的秩序没有影响到，或影响到一个地方系统。
 
你可能会惊讶地发现，除了神话之外，DK（在他向AAB传送信息的时候）并不知道Lyricus和第七宇宙中心种族的这些银河系外接触。因此，通过他的遗漏，可以认为他是认为他们不存在。他只是不知道Lyricus的情况，因为这不在他的任务目标之内。他的工作需要更多的关注，当你打开这个 "虫子罐头"（大多元宇宙层次）时，你需要组建一个团队来披露这些信息，因为它太广泛和深入了，一个人无法尝试披露（因此《乌兰图亚之书》的作者性质）。
 
形而上学著作的局限性 [这个小标题是上述问题和答案的延续。 编者注] 。
 
图中右下角的物体与天线相似，代表了人类目前对大多元宇宙的看法中的知识基础。遗憾的是，它被夸大了，因为我不可能描绘出一条足够细的线，而且还能让它清晰可见。我只想说，《乌兰图亚之书》更接近于描绘大物理宇宙的水平视图，而AAB材料更接近于描绘多元宇宙的垂直视图。尽管如此，你可以看到，"天线 "只触及大宇宙的表面。
 
一个人怎么能描绘出无限和扩展的多元宇宙的这种广度和深度？他们不能，如果尝试，他们将做得非常不公正，他们的结果将是误导。现在，DK所描绘的宇宙和多元宇宙被很好地包含在 "天线 "内。他的目的并不是要描绘出多元宇宙的最宏伟的愿景。他的兴趣是描绘本地系统的能量场和它的层次结构，正如他所理解的那样。
 
[为了保持专题安排的连续性，我删除了这个答案中的三个段落，将其放在 "Lyricus教学顺序 "部分。编者按】。］
 
但正如我之前所说，DK在向AAB传送信息时并不知道Lyricus的存在。是的，他知道等级制度超越了他（和大白门）的精神构造，但他不知道有多远，或有什么目的。大门户的发现从未在任何基于地球的宗教区的材料中披露过。鉴于这是Lyricus和人类的单一焦点，你不觉得这很奇特吗？
 
人类宗教领域的这一明显遗漏反映了地球上的宗教如何反对和/或误解科学技术的发展。例如，DK从未在遗传学方面传播过科学，然而，在Lyricus内部，这是知识的核心。对DK来说，科学是Antahkarana、三角形或召唤的妃子（仅举几个例子）。这并不是双螺旋的科学。他的意识形态不具备这种词汇或知识，因此他没有办法直接谈论这些话题。
 
[Antahkarana是一个梵文术语，意思是在日常具体思维的头脑和抽象的精神头脑之间建立一座意识的桥梁，或者詹姆斯所说的更高的头脑。编者注]。
 
层次结构的外部化进展如何？在这一点上，谁和哪些大师在 "人类中 "工作？
 
由爱丽丝-贝利传递的等级制度的愿景是不完整的，因为它不包括Lyricus和环绕中央大太阳的光之部落（仅举两个例外）。这是一个有意的疏忽，旨在简化等级制度的使命并使其本地化。
就等级制度的外化而言，它因星球/物种而异。在第七超级宇宙中，大约有30万亿颗潜在的生命星球。灵魂载体的DNA分布在这些星球中的大约0.0015%，即大约45亿颗星球。你能想象这样一个企业的规模吗？在这些星球中，等级制度被外化的比例非常小--不到1%，即大约四千万颗星球，包括大约84万个不同的物种。
 
正如你所看到的，从等级制度的角度来看，外部化是一个包含了比地球更大范围的过程。与你的问题有关，所有来自白宫的地球代表都在人类中工作。我想你真正的意思是哪些已知的大师在这个时候实际化身为人。
 
[等级制度的外化是AAB/DK教义中的一个主要因素。迄今为止，詹姆斯从未将Lyricus/WingMakers的材料与朱瓦勒描述的外化过程直接联系起来。事实上，詹姆斯从未将这一事件称为 "等级制度的外化"，直到被面向AAB/DK教义的个人问及。然而，材料中的一些暗示表明，詹姆斯以WingMakers网站（1998年）和后来的Lyricus网站（2004年）的形式发起的Lyricus任务实际上代表了等级制度外部化的初始阶段。
 
[在《WingMakers哲学》第四章 "信仰及其能量系统 "中，詹姆斯似乎将 "外化 "描述为 "大师的回归"。"从这里可以看出，詹姆斯自由地讨论了这个话题，认为这是莱里克斯的工作和使命在地球上的自然延伸。另见《基督回归地球》一节。编者按】。］
 
世界上的大师人数 [本小标题是上述答案的延续。 Ed.] 。
 
我不方便透露这个名单。我可以告诉你，大约有165位大师（六级[程度]以上的入门者）在地球上实际存在，他们作为精神团体的先锋，主要通过修行院的活动进行活动。有一些大师冒险离开了相对匿名和保护的修行所，但这些大师的数量不到一打，除了一个名字，你不会在爱丽丝-贝利或其他与白门有关的文献中认出他们。
 
综合的阿凡达 [这个小标题是上述答案的延续。 Ed.]综合的阿凡达是通过Lyricus指导的，如你所知，它与基督一起运作并协调。综合神通密切参与了Lyricus的目标，知道大门户和基督意识的回归激发了一个人类和一个世界的意识，并使之持久。
 
[詹姆斯特别提到 "合成的神通 "这一事实很重要，因为这表明他对最初发表在爱丽丝-A-贝利的深奥哲学书籍中的一个具体术语有详细的了解。
 
AAB的作品提到了各种化身的顺序。阿瓦特 "一词是梵语，一般是指来自较高世界的信使，他访问 "较低 "的世界，以提供精神指导。综合神通被认定为宇宙神通，因此来自我们太阳系以外的某个地方。编者注]。
 
等级制度对即将使用的核武器感到担忧吗？他们会允许在某些情况下使用它们吗？
 
在这个问题上，等级制度内没有一个单一的意见。不管等级制度的干预策略如何，这个宇宙是建立在自由意志的原则之上的。干预是非常、非常仔细地权衡的--不管是在时间序列内还是在时间序列外，都很少进行干预，除非它们大大违背了等级制度的一个主要目标，如发现大门户。
 
耶稣基督与永乐会的关系是什么？
 
对于那些会读到这些话的人，如果他们深受基督教的影响，请原谅我的反应方式。我不是一个在说真话时能巧妙沟通的人。
耶稣化身的目的不是为了产生一种宗教。他只是表达了他对精神层面的看法，使 "第一源泉 "变得易懂和单一。他的同胞们是如此渴望预言的实现，以至于他们把弥赛亚的衣钵强加给他，他犹豫地同意承担。
 
耶稣目前在我之前谈到的教学组织中担任领导角色，该组织由地球上真正的精神领袖组成。[詹姆斯指的是等级制度。］
 
他对WingMakers和Lyricus都非常了解。一个有趣的脚注：虽然宗教组织争夺人类成员，但那些负责宗教起源的教师却在同一个大胆的旗帜--人类进化下进行协作和合作。
 
那些已经从物理领域转化为跨维领域的教师仍然是人类的强大教师。他们把重点从个人主义的使命转移到合作的使命，在这种合作精神中，作为人类条件的变革者，他们变得越来越强大。尤其是耶稣，他作为教学组织[等级制度]的总经理，在这个角色中，与Lyricus就大门户的规划和分析进行沟通。
 
教学核心有一个共识，即科学、艺术和宗教的融合是不可避免的，它将最终导致对人类灵魂的科学发现，更具体地说，人类灵魂是如何设计的。就像肉体有一个人类基因组一样，精神的身体，或者说整体性导航仪，也有一个精神基因组。而这个基因组的理解远比人类重要，因为它是因果要素，而人类基因组是受体。
 
这项工作有六个部分的协调。
 
1.Lyricus设计、移植并安装银河系支流区到一个行星系统。
 
2.地球教师（非物理的）为接受大门户的物种做准备。
 
3.地球教师（身体）通过支流区发现通往大门户的道路。
 
4.地球教师（物理）传播和保存大门户的知识。
 
5.地球教师（物理的和非物理的）将人类联合到主权整体网络。
 
6.源头智能和Lyricus在整个大宇宙中促进这一进程。
 
耶稣的作用在第二阶段非常重要，在大约八十年后的第五阶段也是如此。他基本上是在整个升天（非物理）教师的教学组织的合作协助下领导这个过程。[首次发表于2001年7月9日，编者注] 。
 
基督的回归原定于2025年左右。这个日期是否被提前了一些，如果是的话，现在的大致时间是什么？
 
[尽管耶稣基督的回归通常与许多基督教教派有关，但这种宗教信仰在爱丽丝-贝利/DK书籍的精神哲学中也起着核心作用。这种信仰与标准的基督教观点截然不同。在贝利/DK的方案中，基督回归世界更符合东方信仰的化身，或来自精神世界的信使，而不是作为救世主或弥赛亚。这样的回归并不支持任何特定的宗教。此外，这样的事件没有给出具体的日期，因为根据该方案，它是由人类的精神成长和成熟度决定的。编者注]。
基督再来的时间与无形教会出现的时间有关。这两者是不可分割的。在Lyricus的词汇中，隐形教会是大门户的出现，以及它作为传统宗教和信仰系统的统一平台的卓越地位。基督意识只会让无形教会准备好在人类的内心和更高的思想中掌权，而基督实际上将在此后的进化服务中升华。
 
关于你的时间问题，对于涉及复杂的人类决定的事件，不可能有具体的时间措施。归根结底，这确实是一个人的决定，而不是等级制度强加的决定。
 
翼人项目和其他五六个项目与基督或世界导师的重新出现有什么关系？
 
等级制度--而不是基督化的人--将首先出现，他们将专注于把新的心理学和形而上学带到二十一世纪。
翼人的教义是这个外部化过程的第一个阶段，包括将支流区的催化力量传送到世界人口的通信网络中。
 
基督徒是一个能量场，伴随着这些教义和那些沉浸在支流区的个人，目的是加速他们的意识，以发现大门户。
 
基督化的人不会回来，只是在大门户的后发现期得到承认而已。这是地球和人类物种的意识转变。一套特定的技术将使基督的承认成为可能，这被称为大师的回归。在现实中，世界导师将是大门户。
 
根据你对宇宙论/宇宙学的了解，我们是否可以预期在不久的将来会出现一个 "反基督者"？如果是的话，反基督者的性质是什么？我们是指一个人、一种思想模式、一种态度、一个外星人、Animus、一个国家等吗？
 
反基督者的概念作为一种神话和预言，具有很强的渗透力。这是一个非常复杂的话题，我缺乏足够的时间来正确处理这个问题。为了理解反基督者，你必须首先理解基督，而这正是大多数关于反基督者的定义或预言失败的地方。
基督，非个人化的，是人类从压抑的能量系统的控制中得到的救赎，该系统将人类置于意识的生存模式中。基督是大门户。
 
因此，反基督者被表现为一系列势力的集合，这些势力因为害怕大门户的发现而抵制它所带来的变化。具有讽刺意味的是，这些势力主要来自宗教中心，因此，政府在许多情况下将被迫跟随。
 
如果我说反基督者是有组织的宗教，这将是一个过于笼统的说法。我只能告诉你，人类主要宗教组织背后的势力最终将联合起来，全力抵制这一发现。这在许多预言中都有预示，但宗教当局一直不愿意分享它。这在宗教界并不常见，但地球上主要的宗教活动权力中心都拥有一个内部的权威圈子，这些人至少隐约知道这些预言，而且在一个例子中，他们对21世纪的未来非常清楚。
 
我的理解是，每个宇宙都是一个一个地创造出来的，借鉴了从以前的宇宙中获得的知识。如果是这样的话，那么我们的未来是否会有第八个（或更多）宇宙？
 
这当然是一种可能性，但我不能肯定地说，这将会发生，或者是神圣计划的一部分。我不得不回答，"我不知道"。
 
在我们文化的神话中，是否有关于其他六个宇宙的记载？
 
不，物理宇宙的单一性是影响古往今来所有文化的最普遍和持久的神话之一。七个宇宙有时与意识的内部维度相混淆，但这些内部维度与物理宇宙相对应--因此，每个宇宙都由外部和内部维度组成，这些多个维度在生命形式最集中的地方最具有效力。
例如，地球的内部维度比木星周围存在的维度要发达得多，尽管木星恰恰比地球大10.7倍。生命形式的集中和这些生命形式对基因思维、源头智能和实体意识的可及性，创造了这种交织的多维世界矩阵。当多重性，或 "世界"、"平面 "或 "境界 "在神话甚至现代描述中被描绘出来时，他们指的是这些内在维度，而不是物理大宇宙的七个宇宙。
 
我们文化中的神话是否也提到了来自其他宇宙的生命，或者只是我们自己的宇宙？例如，天使是否来自另一个宇宙？
 
其他六个宇宙的有知觉的生命形式的物理工具不会跨越到我们的宇宙，反之亦然。这七个宇宙在振动上（空间上）和基因上（生物结构上）是隔离的。这有助于确保一个宇宙中的物种的进化途径不会与另一个宇宙发生碰撞或冲突。它使多样性成为可能。它使近乎无限的进化延伸成为可能。虽然物理仪器不能跨越，但个性化的意识可以。在这种程度上，有一些生命从一个宇宙 "移居 "到另一个宇宙。这并不类似于升天的过程。
关于你有关天使的问题，天使并不来自第七宇宙（我们的宇宙）之外。事实上，他们也不是来自我们的银河系之外。
 
你是否反对Zeta Reticuli和银河系联邦，如果他们存在的话？
 
我不是。而他们确实存在。这就是简短的答案。
至于Zeta Reticuli，他们就像所有复杂的类人物种一样；他们的行为具有多重性。没有单一的个性来定义这个物种。以人类的标准来看，Zeta网状体的一些派别或亚文化是令人不快的，然而他们的行为有其原因，我理解这些原因。因为我理解他们，所以我可以忠实地报告，虽然我不支持或尊重他们的行为，但我并不把他们当作敌人来反对。我只是撤回我的支持，并在与我交往的人中公开承认这一点。
 
关于银河系联邦，这是一种等级指挥和控制的形式，虽然我尊重它的使命，支持它的目的，但我个人不受它的统治约束，也不受它的等级结构的制约。然而，我确实尊重银河系联邦的意见，并会仔细权衡他们的建议对我个人任务的影响程度。
 
[请注意，关于源头组织调整（SOA）的部分指出，像银河系联邦这样的等级秩序是存在的。苏美尔人、埃及人和印度人等古代文明所记录的等级森严的神殿，可能是银河系联邦等宇宙SOA在地球上的反映。詹姆斯在SOA部分关于地球上的主教师等级制度的评论进一步说明了这一点。编者注]。
 
我们什么时候才能看到ET公开在地球上走动，并与地球上的人类混合？当然，假设ET政府的官方披露首先发生？在这些事件中，WingMakers将扮演什么角色？
 
请原谅我在你的问题上搞点娱乐活动。你所在的每个地方都有外星人。你们的科学家们都知道一个事实，那就是人类形态的原子结构是由恒星的粒子衍生出来的。因此，人类的工具本质上是外星的。
先把这个问题放在一边。是什么使人类的工具有了活力？身体里有什么？难道它不是由被称为第一源泉的灵魂原型所产生的理解的意识吗？这难道不是来自外星的吗？生命力和表达这种力量的身体都不属于这个地球。你们所说的人类，我们称之为中央宇宙的主权实体（SECU-发音为SeeQue）。
 
SECU是α和omega。它们不受时间的限制，也不受身体的装饰所约束。他们是最原始的形式，完成并磨练了他们的创造者的完美，而在这一点上，我们都是一样的。
 
现在，对于你的观点，外星人正在地球上走动，你只是没有认出他们是外星人，因为人类的基因组和许多外星种族的基因组基本上是一样的。在未来的十年里，会有不同的ETs出现，但他们不会干扰社会秩序。
 
当大门户由人类之手揭开时，你们将引起银河系联盟的注意，人类将被邀请参与银河系大家庭的事务。到那时，类人种的多样性将得到赞赏，正是因为这个原因，人类必须首先理解自己是一个SECU，其次才是人类。
 
ETs和ufo现象呢？我认为这其中很多都涉及到乙方的魔鬼，但不是全部。为什么这样一个庞大的话题会在深奥的教义中被掩盖。如果DK提到了它，那么它就被掩盖得很好。大多数深奥的学生都没有将这种ET现象与不朽的智慧结合起来，在我看来，这里似乎错过了一些重要的东西。我对整合这两个领域很感兴趣，并将于5月4日在费城地区的一个ufo团体做演讲。如果可能的话，我想对这些领域进行综合和沟通。(Devas（梵文）是基督教世界所说的天使。魔鬼在我们银河系的生命表达中扮演着重要而又神秘的角色。在第三次聂鲁达访谈中提到了天使，在第四次访谈中也非常简短地提到了天使。Ed.)
 
ET现象太复杂了，大多数人都无法解决或消化。如果你提出这个难题的一端，你就不得不承认，你不知道另一端。这同样适用于媒体、科学、政治家、军队、军工企业和宗教。有充分的证据表明地球上有外星人的互动，但这些证据很难被引导到一个单一的、可理解的 "畜栏 "中，以便公众能够理解这一现象，而不觉得被蒙蔽或受到威胁。有一些人正试图这样做（格里尔博士），但他们基本上不会成功，因为证据都集中在阴谋的掩盖上，而不是ET的议程或长期目的上。
对于你所说的魔鬼，他们并没有与ET和UFO现象相混淆。只有在极少数情况下，人们才会犯这种身份上的错误。然而，ET和我们情报界的各派都在进行非常复杂的灌输计划。这些都是造成ET/UFO报告频繁出现的原因，如绑架事件。请记住，根据定义，我是一个ET。从更广泛的角度来看，我们都是。我们都源于外星的起源。我们中的一些人只是比其他人记得更清楚。
 
你与其他与地球有关的外星种族是什么关系？阿尼姆斯人是真实的还是虚构的？
 
目前，我的关系是与人类的关系。除了与Lyricus的古老联系外，我没有与我相信你所说的外星种族进行互动。至于阿尼姆斯，他们是非常真实的。
 
等级制度中是否存在Animus的影响？如果是的话，他们的意图是否是为了尽量减少SECU的出现？
 
在Animus中存在着巨大的个性差异，就像在整个人类中一样。阿尼姆斯内部有一些派别，他们只想成为灵魂载体，与人类和谐相处；还有一些派别想取代类人基因组，统治他们的世界。在这种背景下，对你的问题的回答是一个有条件的 "是"。SECU功能的出现是某些Animus派别的首要关注点，与之相关的大传送门的发现也是如此，原因很简单，它将人类与整个第七宇宙的更广泛的类人家庭联系起来。[缩写 "SECU "代表着 "中央宇宙的主权实体"。"编者按】。］
 
就 "封住邪恶居住的大门 "而言，等级制度如何看待目前的后伊拉克局势？黑暗兄弟会是否重新获得了二战前的权力，当时它通过轴心国开展工作？从白袍和黑袍之间的权力平衡来看，目前的情况是否被认为是不稳定的？目前谁占了上风？
 
[黑暗之家 "是对一群实体的称呼，他们试图将人类囚禁在纯物质主义的范围内。通过他们的影响，人类被关在恐惧、分离和精神黑暗中。同样，这个术语在贝利/Djwhal Khul的哲学文本中使用，但以 "黑屋 "或 "黑暗兄弟会 "出现。"白门 "是一个相当于地球教师等级制度的术语。编者注]。
黑暗之家继续在地球的物质和情感层面上消耗和投射力量，而不考虑外部的战争事件。换句话说，战争和政治动荡不是黑暗之门的晴雨表。相反，黑暗之门的迹象是在成人和儿童的伦理中发现的，以及在集体的基础上，这些情景伦理如何重新引导全球文化偏离神圣的善意。[请注意，詹姆斯对 "向善的意愿 "一词的运用是爱丽丝-贝利/DK词典的一部分。在这里，詹姆斯表明他对这个词典的了解。编者注]。
 
在 "整体性导航仪"（人类灵魂的一个组成部分）被发现并被足够数量的人类实际应用之前，黑暗势力将在这个物理领域占据主导地位。他们的统治是由于人类缺乏对 "整体性导航仪 "在高级心灵中所固定的统一力量的认同。这种与灵魂的兄弟情谊分离的感觉是黑暗势力用来招募、保留和激励其追随者的唯一武器。

美国政府和/或以色列特工部门策划了911事件中对世贸中心的袭击，这一阴谋论是否正确？奥萨马-本-拉登在这次行动中的同谋程度如何？
 
除了那些执行者之外，没有人策划了9/11惨案。黑暗势力并没有策划它。它是一个自然的、有机的事件，产生于世界上被切断联系、被剥夺权利的人群，他们努力回击他们认为的文化种族灭绝。
文化种族灭绝（我与种族种族灭绝有所区别）是取代原住民对中东地区资源控制的一种更微妙的方式。人们可以说，黑暗小屋或美国政府知道类似9/11的事情可能发生，但他们没有规定破坏的方法，也没有特别启用。相反，他们投射他们的权力和与之相关的文化专制，知道反应是不可避免的。
 
对于每一个不受约束的权力，都会有一个抵抗运动。这是宇宙的法则，黑暗之家非常清楚这一点。然而，抵抗运动可以被操纵来唤起恐惧，而正是这种恐惧进一步降低了情境伦理，为内卷化打开了大门。
 
 
奥萨马-本-拉登或乔治-布什是否是门徒，如果是，他们的进化状况如何，第一到第二等级（1.3，1.5等）？
 
[这位提问者在提到弟子和入门程度时使用的是神学术语。在这里，弟子是指遵循灵性发展的加速训练路径的学生。这个过程可以是有意识或无意识的。在这个发展道路的 "无意识 "阶段，一个人可能正在经历一个特定的生命，在这个过程中，他或她正在参与一个加速的学习和测试期。在神智学的范围内，入会学位是精神成长和成就的发展水平，基于在一个人选择的精神道路框架内获得的生活经验。编者注]。
关于弟子的级别或进化状况，这是一个非常个人的问题，Lyricus的老师从不透露。此外，任何过分强调入门地位的做法，特别是与你自己无关的，都是错误的能量导向。
 
鉴于最近的悲剧（9月11日），我们如何恢复对大局的一些看法，并将这些恐怖主义事件放在正确的位置？
 
世界被分割成宗教和政治观点，落在一个不断扩大的连续体的不同点上。这种分裂是人类对整体性导航者，即不朽的本质的集体无知的表现。正是这种无知，而且仅仅是这种无知，在观念上不仅将你与第一源头或上帝分开，而且还将你的人类家庭和整个大宇宙中更广泛的生命形式社区分开。
这种无知的具体状况造成了善与恶的二元性及其可靠的罪恶阴影。正如媒体所描绘的那样，美国的敌人，乃至整个自由世界的敌人，已经被塑造成一个不为人知的恐怖分子网络，他们是邪恶的化身，而我们，自由世界，则作为善的化身挺立着。我邀请你们思考这种模式的脆弱性。
 
人类成功的概念结构并不在于简单的善胜于恶的概念。相反，它在于科学和技术资源的投资，加上人类自力更生的聪明才智，以发现整体性导航仪，并与世界人民分享这一发现。这不会在人类的充分合作下完成。事实上，它从来都不是这样。总有一些人害怕在这一重要发现之后发生的变化，从而产生了抑制作用。
 
恐怖主义网络是这种抑制效应的一个方面，它将攻击所有统一人类的努力，而且它不会是唯一的抵抗形式。随着人类进入其未来三代的展开，这个网络将反复考验它，有时，正如本周所见证的那样，会有残酷的效果。具有讽刺意味的是，恐怖主义履行了它所回避的角色，因为共同的敌人使人团结。
 
那些人口中的元素，无论是像朝鲜和伊拉克这样的国家，还是激进的宗教派别，都有一个共同点：他们害怕世界人民的统一，因为他们担心自己独特的民族、文化和宗教习俗会被消灭，而那些争取统一的人口则认为他们的文化将成为新的、全球社会的基石。这是我们这个时代的一个基本焦虑。
 
一旦一个世界的人口达到了全球通信的阶段，那些能够应用全球通信平台的国家自然会寻求一个概念结构，首先在经济上，然后在军事上统一人口。地球在这两个领域都进展顺利，但恐怖主义网络的抑制作用将有助于缓和民众统一的意愿。一旦这种统一建立起来，人们将能够更好地合作和分享，而这正是整体性导航仪的科学发现所要求的。
 
对最近这些袭击的残酷性感到愤怒是完全理性的；在更广泛的背景下理解它们也是明智的。我们的政治、军事和媒体领导人不同意这种观点，不是因为他们缺乏感性，而是因为他们的参考系统旨在保护前几代人所确立的我们的自身利益，而不是理解更广泛的背景，因为它涉及到未来的重要发现。
 
我知道在你们每个人的脑海中都有一个咬牙切齿的问题。这种入侵性的恐怖主义会导致什么，会走多远？它是否会导致一场世界大战？世界经济是否会因此而减弱？对于后两个问题，我可以回答是的，但它不会超越世界统一的进程，而是加速其实现。虽然需要作出牺牲，但它将在地球上的国家和部落之间产生一种新的集体目的和联系的感觉。
 
如果你仍然沉浸在媒体对这一戏剧性故事的表达中，你可能会被诱导去像我们的领导人那样思考和行动，即以保护自由世界的自我利益为中心。相反，你可以选择在即将到来的时代中更多地依靠你内心深处的领导力，并将这些事件放在未来旅程的更大背景下--无论是对你个人还是整个人类。
 
你们每个人都必须感觉到，好像你们在不知不觉中走过了一扇门，在看到另一边的东西后，你们想从哪里回来，但门在你们身后上了锁。我们已经进入了一个新的世界，在那里，你的脆弱性已被鲜明地勾勒出来。摆在面前的不是我们有意识的设计，而是我们积累的自我利益和对整体性导航仪的普遍无知的表现，在潜意识里，地球上很少有人没有意识到这一点。
 
没有人可以为这种状况负责。它是一个类人物种实现科学发现更高维度的漫长过程中的一个进化要素，而人类就是从这些维度编织而成的。在这个旅程中，人类曾经挣扎过，但它总是能找到通往最终目标的道路，而正是这个目标--尽管它可能是微妙的--试图在你们所有在这个时候化身的人的心中阐明自己。
 
在整个21世纪，将有新的考验袭击人类；有些考验将比本周目睹的考验更深刻地震撼人心。无一例外，你们的领导人将在善与恶之间划出一条界线，并寻求消除邪恶，而在每一种情况下，目标只会进一步延伸到蒙昧和去中心化的深渊中。
 
所有有生命的星球都有一个战略计划，而这个计划不是一开始就确立，然后就被丢在一边。它不断地在进行完善和调整。这个计划中唯一稳定的是最终的目标；旅程本身在编织、停滞、加速，有时甚至方向逆转。然而，第一源泉的指导之手从未松开，也不会无动于衷，这只手也触及到你的最深处--特别是在这样的时刻，它提供了洞察力。
 
我给你们每个人的信息是，在夜晚或早晨的宁静中，在天空、海洋、森林或田野的自然方式中，倾听这种洞察力，并邀请它揭示在肉体中生存的情感智慧。即使在今天和未来的不稳定时期，也要允许它在你的心和脑中占上风。当你捕捉到这种洞察力时，通过你的触觉、视觉、听觉和声音来表达它，把它固定在你的生活中。你可以把它看作是放心的振动。这是你想带在身上并分享的振动。
 
犹太复国主义者在二战前后都是黑暗兄弟会的工具。"那扇门的 "密封 "没有成功完成，及时发现这一点是智慧的一部分。这些邪恶势力通过一个邪恶的三角形来工作，其中一个点可以在美国的犹太复国主义运动中找到，另一个点在欧洲中部，第三个点在巴勒斯坦。巴勒斯坦不再是圣地，不应该被这样看待。"这个三角关系是否仍然通过美国政府中的'新教徒'激活？如果是的话，他们的议程在美国对以色列的中东统治方面有多危险？
 
你的问题有不完全准确的潜在假设，因此，如果我直接回答，我的答案必然是模糊不清的。
我只想说，巴勒斯坦和以色列在黑屋的大计划中是次要的元素。它们就像魔术师手中的误导工具。在你集中控制地球重要资源（即石油、天然气、水、粮食商品、黄金、钻石等）的地方，你会发现黑暗势力在那里活动。利用这一推理，以色列和巴勒斯坦都不拥有这些重要资源。
这些资源是黑暗势力的命脉，也是他们崛起和行使贪婪的权力基础。这种情况已经持续了几百代。这对地球来说是真实的，就像任何拥有灵魂载体DNA的生命星球在大门前时间一样。
 
一个星球的重要和宝贵的资源吸引着那些认同权力而不是兄弟情谊的人；剥削而不是合作。这就是黑暗小屋的根本基础。
 
教会认为解决以色列/巴勒斯坦危机的紧迫性如何？如果局势不能尽快解决，马努是否考虑采取严厉的措施？
 
中东危机的解决都是相互关联的。以色列/巴勒斯坦冲突是由几乎取之不尽、用之不竭的相互怨恨所助长的，而这一切都涉及到文化种族灭绝和重要资源控制权转移的问题。
当美国原住民经历这个过程时，他们最初有抵抗运动，但最终屈服于白人扩张主义运动的无尽力量。在这场冲突中，情况不会是这样。它将在停火和敌对性恢复的循环中持续数十年。
 
第五种族的马努并不关心这种事情。如果它是，它就不会为灵魂载体DNA的下一个进化标准做准备。这就是目前消耗马努的重要任务。[见注2.编者按]。
 
世界性的经济衰退是否迫在眉睫？等级制度是否认为这对于制定一个新的货币制度是必不可少的？
 
有一句禅宗谚语。鱼最后注意到的是水。经济衰退正在进行中，而且是全球性的。它是黑暗势力控制货币/资产/重要资源供应的结果。只要大门户所需的技术继续得到投资，等级制度就不会关注货币系统（它将会）。
 
"在人类的心理有一种持久的记忆--特别是那些被一心想要殖民化的国家所践踏的弱小文化。这些对世界上弱小国家的悲愤，在他们的集体记忆中留下了深深的印记。为了使人类在治理和基本制度上变得统一，这种记忆被抹去或清除是至关重要的。这个事件可以是精心策划的，也可以通过自然手段发生，但人们普遍认为，必须出现一个激发世界人民团结起来的事件，在这个过程中，清除所有民族的记忆，但特别是那些被当作殖民化受害者处理的民族。"(这段引文摘自《聂鲁达访谈录四》。编者注)你说的 "清除 "和 "抹去 "到底是什么意思？杀掉这些文化，还是想办法医治他们的集体记忆，还是其他什么？
 
净化，在这里指的是释放受害者的记忆，以利于为共同的事业和/或目的团结起来，共同建设，而不是参与复仇-破坏的破坏性循环。同样，大门户的发现是一个足够大的激励事件/过程，将这些集体记忆转变为释放，并创造一个新的行为模式，这是这些变化能够持续的唯一途径。
 
 
蒙托克项目和WingMakers之间的关系是什么（如果有的话）？
 
我将让你们窥探一下导致蒙托克项目发生的情况。
一个非常聪明的人，名叫范尼瓦尔-布什（与GWB没有关系），在ACIO新成立时，他领导了一小群杰出的物理学家，与ACIO一起工作。
 
布什是这支科学力量的表面领导者，他的任务是对UFO技术进行一些重新设计的壮举。这些最初的外星技术被特意留待发现，作为加速网络发展的手段（互联网是第一阶段，SIN是高潮阶段）。[见词汇表中的 "主权整体网络"（Sovereign Integral Network）。
 
政府和军队内部的保密墙总是透不过气来，而布什成为著名的这些技术的卓越调查者。这个项目比曼哈顿计划的安全性更高。然而，由于布什太显眼，而且有潜在的风险，这个重新设计项目被输送到ACIO，布什有机会加入。
 
他拒绝了，因为需要基本上离开社会，变得匿名。布什，甚至在那个时候，被中央赛区培养来帮助发明第一阶段的网络基础设施，他有一个半自觉的意识，即他的真正使命是参与这一努力，而不是ACIO。
 
十五号也被培养为这个职位，但他被认为不太值得信任，因为军方和Incunabula可以依靠他来执行自己的议程。尽管如此，十五被认为是一个更聪明、更有能力的人，可以发起这样的发现，了解这些外星技术的潜力。
 
在布什领导重新设计工作期间，他被要求参与最早的时间旅行实验。甚至爱因斯坦也在这些实验中被短期咨询过，这些实验是在绝对保密的情况下进行的。结果虽然不成功，但确实在因库纳布拉内部产生了一种热情（所有明显的原因）；然而，军方没有给予任何额外的资金，因此该项目被关闭。
 
该项目文件最后落到了Fifteen的手中，其中有一些内容被认为是有用的（处理消磁的短暂状态）。该项目文件的一个副本也在布鲁克海文结束了。这个副本后来变成了蒙托克项目，但很快就被转移到了精神控制实验中，结果出了问题。军方真正控制了蒙托克，而Incunabula则控制了ACIO（在其发展的早期）。
 
现在，至于这些人的可信度以及他们与造翼者的关系，我将留给你。我只想补充一点，中央种族通过个人的方式工作，他们不知道他们正在被工作。那些声称有这种交流的人一般都没有这种交流。
 
如果他们与大门户保持一致，那么在他们的行为和语言中就会很明显，即使他们不知道造翼者或宇宙的内在本质。我理解你的感叹，即人们错过了精神上的暗流，有时会冲向阴谋和掩饰的肤浅漩涡。这两部剧在性质上非常不同，但它们并非不相容。
 
你对用于识别和执法的芯片植入有什么看法？你会避免或接受这种植入人体工具的做法吗？
 
我会用我所有的能力和法律手段来抵制它，但如果有一天它成为一项法律，我被要求接受这样的植入物，我会勉强接受它，因为它是一项法律，而且只有在它的主张有一定的价值时才会成为一项法律。植入物不会影响我的任何行为、举止、态度或任何其他表现。
 
全球性的事件，如战争、饥荒、环境问题等，在人类发现大门户，或从第三维度进入第四维度的过程中是否有任何作用？
 
重要的是要明白，人类实现这一发现是其进化过程的自然延伸。在这条道路上，散落着一个不成熟的种族的愚蠢行为，这些愚蠢行为可能会阻止或限制安全通过大门户。但幸运的是，进化不是一个单一的身体或精神能力的轨道，它被安排在一个不断增加的能力和适应技能的结构中。进化是在数以千计的微观路径上运行的，其中许多最深刻的路径是人类感官所看不到的。
人类正在从相对黑暗的第三维度进入第四维度的方向是现代新纪元运动的一个误解。
 
人类进化以拥抱多元宇宙，随着它的进化，它发现它的超级宇宙以违背逻辑的方式为人类的头脑所接受。这是人类正在进入的阶段，它不是在振动的顿悟中上升到一个更高的维度，而是要与更广泛的多元智能宇宙互动，而在这之前，只有少数人类最优秀的代表能够想象到。
 
人类将保持在第三维度，但在生活在第三维度的同时，将越来越多地意识到更高的维度，甚至像第一源，它的创造者那样。第一源头生活在第三维度，但同时意识到自己在整个多元宇宙的光谱中，并通过源头智能，意识到所有维度的所有生命形式。人类最终将通过应用大门户作为 "透镜 "来获得第一源泉意识的认可，从而获得同样的视角。在这个具体的例子中，第一源泉与其说是上帝，不如说是整体性导航者的原型。
 
高级入世的灵魂[这个答案原本是问题17-S3的一部分。第一部分见《发起人》17-S3A。编者按】。］
 
在接下来的三代中，大量高级灵魂将在地球上化身为人。我们称这种涌入为。球体的对称性。这些高级灵魂（大部分来自这个太阳系之外）将被编码为具有改造的倾向性。到2080年，他们将有两亿多人。这些改造者将为不对称的身体和情感领域带来对称性。这个运动的领导者将负责发现和无可辩驳地证明人类的灵魂。
 
这是人类在这个进化周期中的成就的高潮，也是白袍会内所有人不可否认的目标，因为这个发现不是个人的。它不是被庇护在个人的神圣经验领域里。它是等级制度的外化，它将以其不可磨灭的印记触及每个意识。
 
基督意识将固定它，无形的教会将保护它不受所有试图恶意、压制或阻止这一发现的人的影响。
 
在Lyricus的词汇中，隐形教会是大门户的出现，以及它作为遗留宗教和信仰系统的统一平台的卓越地位。"
