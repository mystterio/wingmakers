Excerpts from Liminal Cosmogony

An Introduction to the Lyricus Book, Liminal Cosmogony
 

Each planet is provided a council of teachers from Lyricus who incarnate within the species and its home planet at specific times in order to establish the entrainment of knowledge in the direction of the Grand Portal.

“Excerpts from Liminal Cosmogony” is one of the more important documents among the writings offered by James. (He is careful to point out that it is a translation from the book, Liminal Cosmogony and not his own writing.) This document is important because it describes, in broad terms, the goal for humanity in this century—a goal that will revolutionize our understanding of who we are as a species and the nature of human life in the multiverse.

A good question to ask at the beginning of this introduction is what do the words “liminal” and “cosmogony” mean. According to Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary,

Liminal means:

1. Of or relating to a sensory threshold.
2. Barely perceptible.
3. Of, relating to, or being an intermediate state, phase, or condition.

Cosmogony means:

1. A theory of the origin of the universe
2. The creation or origin of the world or universe
Liminal Cosmogony is a book about the origin and nature of the world, or universe taken to the limit of our sensory abilities. We can also apply the second and third meanings, but it is quite possible that they do not apply to the database that the Lyricus Teaching Order (LTO) has assembled about the origin of our world and universe. Nevertheless, let us speculate further that it is a book of knowledge concerning the origin of the universe that is so subtle and mysterious that it is barely perceptible. Additionally, because the universe is in continuous change, the knowledge base continues to grow and expand. It should also be mentioned that the word “universe” in these definitions can probably be changed to “multiverse” because of the multi-dimensional nature of the creation as claimed by the LTO.

Now that we have given the book the best meaning we can with our limited language, let’s briefly examine the few details James has given about this mysterious book, Liminal Cosmogony.

In another paper, entitled “The Rising Heart,” James writes the following in the foreword:

“This paper is an excerpt from the original work known as Liminal Cosmogony, a body of teachings employed by the Lyricus Teaching Order. These teachings are the carefully chosen words and energetic transfers of Lyricus teachers, who have expressed them from an ancient, yet, distinctly relevant voice. They are colored in our language and culture not because they are texts composed for our specific species or planet, but because all planets and their inhabitants evolve in a similar ascendant path, passing through transformative shifts to higher light and intelligence.”

“True to the standards of Lyricus, Liminal Cosmogony is not concerned with the cosmological ordering of the multiverse or the physics of time and space as they unravel into the void. The teachers of Lyricus are more concerned with the delicate human connection between the soul and the human instrument, and how this integration can be activated and its activation sustained amid third- and fourth-dimensional emotional turmoil, misinformation, mental static, and spurious electromagnetic fields; to name a few.

Essentially, these descriptions of Liminal Cosmogony tell us that there is a knowledge system within our galaxy that has been developed through millennia by Lyricus; that the Lyricus teachers employ the material in Liminal Cosmogony to prepare humans for the Grand Portal discovery; that all planets and their inhabitants evolve along a similar ascendant path; and that the Lyricus teachers are focused on the “delicate human connection between the Sovereign Integral and the Human Instrument.”

Details of how this psycho-spiritual and social transformation of human civilization unfolds are meager, to say the least, but are slowly being revealed by James as he releases more information. This information is a mix of theory and practice presented through the various mediums available at wingmakers.com and, more directly, through e-books at eventtemples.org, and now available through this collection (see volume II).

According to Liminal Cosmogony, the transformation and redefinition of the human species will take place through an, as yet, unrevealed confluence of particle physics and quantum biology. Proof of the infinite consciousness (Sovereign Integral) and the multidimensional nature of human life will be the crowning achievements of this coming research. This new direction in scientific research is hinted at as psychologist and consciousness researcher Dean Radin writes in his book Entangled Minds:

“The more we look, the more we’ll find quantum effects in biology. And not just minor hiccups, but fundamental processes that, without quantum connections, would not exist at all. Sometime later we’ll find these effects operating in the nervous system, and later in the brain. At that point psi will graduate from the fringe to the mainstream, and then all those strange phenomena studied for over a century, but poorly understood, will be accepted and regarded as being just slightly ahead of their time.”

As mentioned briefly in the introduction to this book, the Grand Portal discovery is the birth of humanity into its destined life within the greater multiverse. This is a fascinating and exhilarating idea that at first seems to be no different than science fiction literature’s descriptions of humankind’s exploration of the cosmos. The key difference, however, is contained in the concept of dimensions beyond the physical. Here are two instances:

As soul experiences different spatial environments within the Superuniverse of its origin, it also experiences different dimensions and non-spatial environments within the multiverse that extend beyond the Superuniverse’s material structure.
The species of a particular planet has a unique ascension path and evolutionary track in order to become an interdimensional force. [Italics mine.]
The key phrase here is humanity’s transformation from “a planetary animal to an interdimensional force.” The scientific research and developments of this century will ultimately lead to the birth of humanity into its new life in the multiverse, in which the exploration of “outer” space as well as “inner” space will take forms we cannot yet imagine.

According to Liminal Cosmogony, a necessary component for achieving this ultimate goal is the scientific differentiation between the soul (Sovereign Integral) and the soul carrier (also referred to as the Human Instrument). The soul carrier consists of our physical, emotional, mental aspects, and the Genetic Mind. The soul is more difficult to define, but essentially it is the core sense of individuality, that sense of pure self-awareness often described by meditators through the centuries. This pure self-awareness can also be described as that sense of self-existence experienced prior to the arising of thought. It is the psychological space existing between thoughts or feelings.

The glossary entry for Entity or Soul describes it as “a fragment of the Universal Spirit Consciousness of First Source. It is composed of a very refined and pure energy vibration that is equal to Source Intelligence (spirit).” In the context of the information offered in Liminal Cosmogony, the soul’s discovery is nothing short of revolutionary— it affects every segment of civilization.

The primary effects of the Grand Portal can be reduced to three major influences. They are:

Institutions of science, religion, and culture are reformatted to embrace the science of multidimensional realities as their core, guiding frequency.
Government leaders are obliged to restructure their political systems to allow for the integration of new systems of knowledge, specifically of the multidimensional universe and the extended brotherhood of intelligent beings that live therein.
Social institutions related to trade and enterprise are reengineered to support the technologies that arise from the discovery of the Grand Portal. These technologies dramatically alter the way of life on a planetary scale. These include soul carrier health, species continuation planning, ecosystem stability, and harmonization of species in service to a planetary educational system.
Obviously, from the descriptions given above, there is an enormous amount of knowledge related to the soul’s nature that goes far beyond the theories of religion, philosophy, and psychology.

Picking up an earlier thread, science fiction has long described the idea of mankind’s exploration and colonization of space and our discovery of extraterrestrial life forms. Liminal Cosmogony specifically, and the written materials in general, carry this concept from universe exploration to multiverse exploration. Not only do humans and other life forms exist in the space-time dimension, but races of beings exist in other dimensions as well. Thus, the LTO perspective expands the boundaries of life beyond the physical universe, into the metaphysical multiverse. The cosmology of today’s astro-physics will give way to a new cosmology of astro-metaphysics. We will not only discover extraterrestrial life, but perhaps more significantly, we will discover extradimensional life.

Excerpts from Liminal Cosmogony
What follows are a series of excerpts from a non-published text known as: Liminal Cosmogony. This record is part of the knowledge system contained within the galactic Tributary Zone of the Milky Way galaxy. Translations are as precise as possible though the words used are not always consistent to the WingMakers’ glossary. When this occurs it is because these particular records are not planetary or species specific, and therefore, have not been reduced to human or earthly terminology, as is the case with the WingMakers’ materials.

THE IDENTITY OF LYRICUS

The Lyricus Teaching Order originates in the Central Race of the seventh Superuniverse. Within the Central Race is a sub-race known symbolically as the WingMakers. Within the WingMakers there is a specific order of beings that are collectively known as Lyricus, and it is this group that is responsible for assembling and exporting the knowledge base necessary for a developing species to scientifically prove the existence of soul and establish the science of multidimensional reality as the nucleus knowledge system of the species.

This outcome of evolution is universal and, in the broadest measure, identical for all species that are based on the biogenetic template of the Central Race, known as the Seventh Archetype Soul Carrier of the Individuated Consciousness of First Source. It is Lyricus that is responsible for shepherding a developing species to the technological and scientific prowess whereby the soul and the soul carrier are distinguished and acknowledged by the species at large.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SPECIES

The Central Race is an ancient race based on the same genetic template as humanoid life elsewhere within the seventh Superuniverse. This template is interconnected and does not relate on an evolutionary scale so much as a density scale. The density of vibration of one planet within the seventh Superuniverse is unique among all other planets, and it is this vibratory condition that prescribes the biogenetic template’s characteristics and thus its propensities and capacities.

Soul carriers of the highest order are no more evolved than the least—as they serve precisely the same functional purpose, only at a different rate of vibration. Indeed, in many ways the soul carriers that are designed to operate in dense vibrations are more sophisticated and evolved than those designed for the more rarified vibrations of the Central Universe. Each soul carrier is part of an unbroken chain of biogenetic structures that are each based on the same configurable template that enables the individuated consciousness to interact on a near-infinite  number of organic and synthetic planets and spatial environments.

The souls that inhabit higher order soul carriers are typically more experienced than those that inhabit soul carriers designed for denser vibrations, but this is a generalization and not a rule. As soul experiences different spatial environments within the Superuniverse of its origin, it also experiences different dimensions and non-spatial environments within the multiverse that extend beyond the Superuniverse’s material structure.

Physical space requires that soul—which is non-physical—be carried in an instrument of protection, perception, and interaction. It is through this membrane of perception and expression that soul can transform the physical environment, and in this process transform itself. It is this exchange of energy between the individuated consciousness and the species’ soul carrier that enables the species to transform from a planetary animal to an interdimensional spiritual force.

The species of a particular planet has a unique ascension path and evolutionary track in order to become an interdimensional force. This occurs through three primary manifestations:

The species as a whole learns how to fuse the soul carrier to its individuated consciousness and operate the soul carrier as an integrated extension of the individuated consciousness. When this occurs the soul carrier is vibrationally shifted to resonate with the soul, and this ability—at the species level—occurs as an outgrowth of the discovery of the Grand Portal.
The species is inducted as a member of standing on the Superuniverse Network and has established lines of communication with post Grand Portal species within their spatial zone.
The species—through the science of multidimensional reality—is able to manage, with responsible stewardship, its planet and complementary life forms, and ward off non-complementary life forms in a posture of non-violence.
These capabilities and conditions must converge in the species before it is allowed to operate interdimensionally as a collective force. Each species, or more specifically, sub-species of the Central Race, ultimately returns to its origins. In this case, its origins are instilled deep inside the soul carrier coding or DNA. It is an indelible instinct to locate the true origins of the species, and the Grand Portal discovery provides the first verifiable evidence linking the species to a greater brotherhood whose lineage is extraterrestrial.

The Lyricus Teaching Order does not distribute this knowledge openly like a teacher distributes their knowledge to students in a classroom. Each planet is provided a council of teachers from Lyricus who incarnate within the species and its home planet at specific times in order to establish the entrainment of knowledge in the direction of the Grand Portal.

The great inventions and revelations of a species are most frequently accorded to a person who was not the true originator of the idea, but was the person who assembled the resources to make the idea a standard of knowledge. The Lyricus Planetary Council whispers the seeds of knowledge to the greater minds of the species, but remain themselves in the shadows of recognition. This is how the species is led to develop its planetary communications network, which is the very foundation for the Grand Portal discovery.

THE OUTWARD DISCLOSURES OF LYRICUS

The Teaching Order of Lyricus only becomes exoteric within the species at the stage when the communications network is accessible to private domiciles and the technology is sufficiently secure to prevent seizure; the political system is sufficiently open to prevent censorship; and the host environment is sufficiently trusted to prevent modification. When these conditions are attained, the teachings of Lyricus are brought to the species upon the network that will ultimately serve as the distribution hub for its knowledge system.

Generally, these teachings will be brought forward in several “impressions”. The first is the announcement that formalizes its arrival and is observable to the greater network of workers who are involved – no matter how significantly—in the discovery of the Grand Portal. This typically occurs in the third precursor generation; however, in some species it is earlier or later by one generation.

During this first introduction, the teachings of Lyricus are fundamentally depicted and articulated. These would include the discourses, cosmology, and activation resources. Activation resources are encoded sensory data streams that are translated by Lyricus teachers into the media format and sensory system prevalent to the species.

The second impression of the teachings is made available to select students who have been identified as architects of the Grand Portal discovery. These teachings are increasingly esoteric in nature and are exclusively relevant to the new science of multidimensional realities that will act as the foundation stone for the discovery of the Grand Portal.

The activation resources are initially muted because the immaturity of the media and communications network reduces the data stream and its activation influence. As the network evolves and more data can be embedded, the activation resources become more potent. This generally occurs during the second precursor generation.

The third impression of the Lyricus teachings occurs when the core frequencies of the activation materials are distilled into a technology that can entrain the heart-brain system of the soul carrier. This heightened activation technology enables those who have incarnated with specific functions associated with the Grand Portal discovery and its propagation to resist the natural inertia and fear reaction of the establishment.

It is these individuals—many of whom incarnate from Lyricus—that will lead the discovery of the species’ soul, and as importantly, the propagation of this breakthrough into the new institutions resulting from the discovery.

The fourth and final impression from the Lyricus teachings occurs after the Grand Portal’s discovery and establishes the application of the Grand Portal to the species’ requirements in the realms of spiritual advancement and educational systems. The latter element is the most critical of the four impressions because it sustains the knowledge across generations. As there are three precursor generations that reveal the Grand Portal, there are generally three successor generations that transmit and diffuse the findings of the Grand Portal into the social, cultural, political, and scientific institutions of the species.

The occasion just preceding and following the discovery of the Grand Portal is the most critical because it is this point in time that is most susceptible to revision, suppression, and outright subjugation of the findings revealed in its discovery. The manner in which the findings are released to public scrutiny is of vital consequence, and Lyricus has developed a precise set of protocols to help in the efficiency and effectiveness of this transmission.

THE FINDINGS OF THE GRAND PORTAL

Notwithstanding the efficacy of these protocols, there are instances where the discovery of the Grand Portal was successfully suppressed by established institutions that foresaw their ruin or replacement in the dawning of this discovery. This fear reaction is a natural result of perceived displacement, which is why Lyricus specializes in the psychology of change management, and why the transmission protocols are so rigorously tested and refined.

The primary findings of the Grand Portal can be reduced to four fundamental knowledge systems. The effects of these systems are described below:

The soul carrier function is muted or diminished in proportional sympathy to the species’ perception of soul.
The species is unified at multiple levels that transcend time and place. This unification is essential to its vibrant survival as well as its ascension pathway as a spiritual force that animates and preserves the knowledge defined by the species.
The species is innately connected to a vast network of related life forms each based on the biogenetic soul carrier archetype of the Central Race specific to its superuniverse. Collectively, these species represent the cellular structure of First Source, while the individuated consciousness represents the indivisible particle thereof.
The individuated consciousness is orchestrated by the species to produce a knowledge path that leads the species to its creator and upholder. It is this return—like a migratory journey enjoined by a fierce tailwind—that is accelerated by the Grand Portal.
The individual is not existential, nor truly independent of the species. The individual is not supreme, nor is it the reward of consciousness. The individual is less an artifact of First Source than it is of the species. The soul carrier is ultimately transformed and fused with the individuated consciousness to the point it is indiscernible as a separate component of consciousness, but the individual remains devoted to the archetype of the species.

IMPLICATIONS AND EFFECTS OF THE GRAND PORTAL

The primary effects of the Grand Portal can be reduced to three major influences. They are:

Institutions of science, religion, and culture are reformatted to embrace the science of multidimensional realities as their core, guiding frequency.
Government leaders are obliged to restructure their political systems to allow for the integration of new systems of knowledge, specifically of the multidimensional universe and the extended brotherhood of intelligent beings that live therein.
Social institutions related to trade and enterprise are reengineered to support the technologies that arise from the discovery of the Grand Portal. These technologies dramatically alter the way of life on a planetary scale. These include soul carrier health, species continuation planning, ecosystem stability, and harmonization of species in service to a planetary educational system.
RESISTANCE TO THE GRAND PORTAL

The areas of resistance to the Grand Portal are predictable if not avoidable. Resistance is largely predicated on three basic factors:

Is particle energy used as a weapon and/or an energy resource?
Is religion fragmented or unified?
Is machine intelligence managed by species’ intelligence?
Socio-Political Resistance

Because particle energy is a core component of the Grand Portal discovery, the species is aware of the inherent power of particle energy before it has discovered the Grand Portal. This awareness can provide unlimited resources for energy production, and it can also be a weapon of coercion to seize control of planetary resources.

If the species is using particle energy as a weapon of intimidation among its own members, it is more likely to resist the approach of the Grand Portal because the discoveries of the Grand Portal introduce an indisputable range of intelligent life forms whose relationships are initially uncertain. Because of this perceived shift in the balance of supremacy, the evidence of the Grand Portal is resisted and there is a comprehensive stratagem to conceal it.

Religious Resistance

Among species whose religious and spiritual identities are fragmented, religious leaders are essentially in competition. That is to say, leadership has chosen to define the spiritual worlds and individual purpose therein differently. This is common among species that have partial activation of the soul carrier’s sensorial capacity. This fractional capacity is precisely the cause of discordant views by spiritual leaders, and the resulting rivalry is the primary cause of resistance expressed by spiritual leaders when the Grand Portal is discovered.

The resistance generally takes the form of skepticism initially and evolves into indignation and ridicule. Unlike the social and political leaders who can operate in stealth through well-concealed stratagem, spiritual leaders generally resist the Grand Portal after it is discovered and announced, and do so openly.

Technology Resistance

As the species evolves its communication network, machine intelligence begins to eclipse species’ intelligence. Machines of super-intelligence are built that—if not properly managed by the species—can self-evolve at a velocity greater than organic evolution, overtaking the embedded management protocols and allowing machines to dominate the frontiers of science and technology.

When this occurs, the Grand Portal can still be discovered, but the species itself is not sufficiently prepared to assimilate the findings and apply them in service to the formation of new institutions and the transformation of existing ones. When the Grand Portal is revealed solely by machine intelligence, the discovery is hollow and its propagation is typically reserved for the intellectually elite of the species.

The Grand Portal’s discovery is far less significant than the diffusion and propagation of its findings to the species’ educational institutions and planetary scientific class. The discovery holds the promise of the activation of the soul carrier’s sensorial system, which is an intelligence accelerator of significant value to the species.

Species who have both fragmented spiritual identities and deploy particle energy as weapons are among the most resistant to the Grand Portal evidence. Typically the resistance is twofold:

Political operatives predict the dawning of the Grand Portal discovery and a stratagem for its concealment is initiated before the discovery can be adequately corroborated and proven irrefutable.
When the stratagem to conceal fails and the evidence is distributed to the network, spiritual leaders offer the next wave of resistance by doubting the motivations of those leaders responsible for its discovery, since all or most do not subscribe to the belief systems defined and/or upheld by the spiritual leaders.
The period immediately preceding the discovery of the Grand Portal is the most critical. This episode of time is known as the Attestation Period, the time when critics will rise with full voice and unrestrained reluctance to resist the implications of the Grand Portal because they are aware—dimly as it may be—that massive change undermines their control impulse. It is a time when spiritual leaders and politicians join forces to repel this intricate and complex metaphysical and scientific revelation.

This is why the protocols are so carefully engineered by Lyricus to ensure that the leaders involved in the Grand Portal discovery operate skillfully to ensure that resistance is met with intelligent countermeasures that bring the proof of the human soul to the network in a way that cannot be censored, altered or restrained. The network itself will reveal the human soul in a way that is unimaginable and therefore indefensible.

TEMPLATES OF LIFE

While Lyricus exports the genetic template for a species, the template is not physical or material in structure. Across all dimensions of space there exists a primary field of vibration or quantum primacy. This field is non-physical but informs the physical. It exists independent of the physical structures of existence, and can be thought of as Underivative Information Structures (UIS).

UISs are sub-quantum and represent the primary blueprint for living systems and inorganic matter. It is UIS that gives rise to the quantum fields that interpenetrate planets, stars, galaxies, and the universe at large. It is the communication field of life that connects the nonlocal and the local, the individual and the collective, the one and the infinite.

Lyricus brings the master templates that operate at an energetic, quantum level, and are inter-meshed or seated upon UIS, which then acts as the energetic grid for all master templates. Within the master templates are the vibratory fields and biomagnetics that give rise to all dimensional expressions, including the genome of the species or organism and its corresponding energy system and linkages, resonant couplings, and communication systems.

Thus, Lyricus defines the physical borders of a species or organism without exporting a physical representation. Rather it is “programmed” into the master template at the quantum level and this master template activates the sub-programs that ultimately formulate the cellular intelligence or molecular integrity of a living, organic system or inorganic matter.

Species typically uncover these energetic structures after they have fully absorbed and assimilated the physical structures that emerge from the energetic. There are eleven primary fields of vibration and each is interfaced directly with the other. They are not layered in a three-dimensional construct. They are holograhically coiled and encoded in a manner that cannot be expressed with language nor depicted with three-dimensional geometry or spatial relationships.

The master template is the common interface between each field of vibration. Energetically, it is supported and sustained through UIS. UIS, the master templates, and the energetic systems that arise from it are constantly in an interactive process of communication. It is this communication that informs the evolutionary design of a species, organism, or material object—whether organic or inorganic.

This interactive process of the energetic systems is monitored by a frequency of UIS that is called Source Intelligence or the Universal Spirit Intelligence. This frequency absorbs, filters, and processes the communication between the fields of vibration and distills them into packets of information suitable for utilization by First Source. This is the manner in which the interactions between all dimensions of existence are brought into coherence and applicability to the formation of new worlds, species, and dimensional constructs. This is the conduit in which the multiverse evolves and all life within it advances into higher dimensional expressions.

UIS provides the structure behind the quantum fields and energetic systems that yield form and the living systems that support form. The soul carrier is an outcome of the master template that is energetically distributed to life-bearing planets upon the multiverse vehicle of UIS. This template, which creates and interacts with the morphogenetic field of the soul, defines the soul carriers’ limits of functionality and expression—but only in the flow of time.

THE PRESENCE OF SOUL

The soul carrier is in a constant state of flux and development that is the result of the dance between the master template, UIS and the DNA molecule present in each cell. As the soul carrier of the species evolves, the DNA molecule increasingly activates its antenna and responds to the higher dimensional, organizing information field that enables the soul carrier to integrate soul consciousness more fully.

As the soul consciousness enters the soul carrier with greater vibratory force and integration, it vibrationally alters the soul carrier. It does this generally in three distinct ways:

The energy centers of the soul carrier (sometimes referred to as chakras) are the conduits of UIS energy to the soul carrier—at all levels—physically, emotionally, and mentally. This increase in UIS energy vibrationally shifts the soul carrier, causing it to have greater access to the consciousness of soul.
As the frequency of soul is accessed, the soul carrier gains an appreciation and growing realization that it is the carrier wave expression of a God-Fragment interacting with the worlds of linear time, crystallized matter, and three-dimensional space. This new perception portends a transformative identity and value shift.
The DNA molecule is both an antenna that attunes to UIS and the master template, as well as a transmitter of its transformations that are a result of its further intimate contact with the soul consciousness. This transmission is a vibrational frequency that is communicable to the DNA molecules of all others within the species, even affecting related species.
The soul is attuned to UIS and operates therein because this is the vibratory field that is native to its essence. As a greater percentage of the species embody their soul consciousness, it becomes easier for the remaining members to do so as well.

DEVELOPMENTAL SHIFTS

There are four developmental shifts that precede the emergence of the Grand Portal, and these generally occur within three to five generations of the discovery. They are unfolded in the following order:

A physical shift is expressed in the planetary environment and spatial surroundings. This physical shift is symbolic of the momentous changes in the virtual structures that prepare the species for the Grand Portal. The physical shifts generally take expression through weather conditions, astronomical anomalies, ethnic turmoil, technological dysfunction, and disease—all of which impact on economic and planetary stability.
An emotional shift is expressed in the movement of the species to more effectively manage their emotional center (heart) at an energetic, non-physical level, enabling a higher bandwidth connection between the heart and brain centers. This heart-brain connection aligns the energetic centers of the soul carrier to accept a more intense awakening of the intuitive powers innately present in the genetic mind of the species.
A mental shift is expressed as the genetic mind of the species is made more accessible to the species as a result of the previous shift in heart-brain integration. The genetic mind—as the repository of information defined by the species—operates independent of horizontal time flows and can provide quantum leaps in knowledge if its higher dimensional information packets are accessed.
A shift within the genetic mind occurs when the grid of the genetic mind becomes discontinuous, forming into multiple groupings. Members of the species will energetically reorganize into resonant groups, each accessing different regions of the genetic mind and evolving a discrete sub-genetic mind whose resonant coupling is more closely fitted to each group.
These four phases occur sequentially, unfolding in time and informing and catalyzing the next phase until it culminates in the discovery of the Grand Portal. This progression operates in subtle, intricate, and meticulous processes, and despite the apparent surface chaos the deeper ordered systems prevail and entrain the surface effects of time, space and matter.

At the end of the fourth phase the energy of UIS and the virtual structures of the master template begin to “descend” within the planetary dimension of time and space—attracted by the shifting consciousness of the species. Those members of the species that are energetically attracted to the higher dimensional regions of the genetic mind will—during this time—reveal the science of multidimensional reality that has always been encoded into the master template, waiting for the resonance of minds and hearts to uncover it.

The Grand Portal is holographic, emitting from First Source and extending to UIS, embedded within the master template, conducted into the quantum fields of the genetic mind, drawn into the energetic systems of the soul carrier, and finally coiled within the DNA molecule of the species. This masterful interchange of energy, information, and expression is orchestrated by the magnetic field that surrounds the Grand Portal.

The Grand Portal is similar to a gravitational field that entrains all surrounding matter to its presence. This presence is electromagnetically released into the three-dimensional realms, whereby it becomes the beckoning force that literally tows a species through time and space to the Grand Portal, and through the energetic field that it represents.

边缘宇宙论》节选

Lyricus书的介绍，极限宇宙论
 

每个星球都有一个来自Lyricus的教师委员会，他们在特定的时间内化身为该物种及其母星，以便在大门户的方向上建立知识的引导。

"《极限宇宙论》节选 "是詹姆斯提供的著作中比较重要的文件之一。(他小心翼翼地指出，这是从《极限宇宙论》一书中翻译过来的，不是他自己写的）。这份文件很重要，因为它概括地描述了人类在本世纪的目标--这个目标将彻底改变我们对我们作为一个物种是谁以及人类在多元宇宙中的生活性质的理解。

在这篇介绍的开头要问一个好问题，那就是 "边缘 "和 "宇宙论 "这两个词是什么意思。根据Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary。

边缘的意思。

1.属于或与感觉阈值有关。
2.几乎察觉不到。
3.属于，与，或为中间状态，阶段，或条件。

宇宙观的意思是。

1.关于宇宙起源的理论
2.世界或宇宙的创造或起源
极限宇宙论》是一本关于世界的起源和性质的书，或者说是以我们的感官能力为极限的宇宙。我们也可以应用第二和第三种含义，但很可能它们并不适用于Lyricus教学团（LTO）收集的关于我们世界和宇宙起源的数据库。尽管如此，让我们进一步推测，这是一本关于宇宙起源的知识书，它是如此微妙和神秘，几乎无法察觉。此外，由于宇宙处于不断的变化之中，知识库也在继续增长和扩大。还应提及的是，这些定义中的 "宇宙 "一词也许可以改为 "多元宇宙"，因为LTO所宣称的创造的多维性质。

现在我们已经用我们有限的语言赋予了这本书最好的含义，让我们简要地检查一下詹姆斯对这本神秘的书《极限宇宙论》的几个细节。

在另一篇题为 "崛起的心 "的论文中，詹姆斯在前言中写道。

"本文是被称为《极限宇宙论》的原创作品的节选，这是Lyricus教学团采用的一套教义。这些教义是Lyricus教师精心选择的词语和能量转移，他们用一种古老但明显相关的声音来表达。它们在我们的语言和文化中具有色彩，并不是因为它们是为我们特定的物种或星球而创作的文本，而是因为所有的星球和它们的居民都在类似的上升道路上进化，通过转型转变为更高的光和智能。"

"忠实于Lyricus的标准，Liminal Cosmogony并不关心多元宇宙的宇宙学排序，也不关心时间和空间的物理学，因为它们被解构到虚空中。Lyricus的老师们更关注灵魂与人类工具之间微妙的联系，以及如何在第三和第四维度的情绪波动、错误信息、精神静态和虚假的电磁场中激活和维持这种整合；仅举几例。

基本上，这些关于 "边缘宇宙论 "的描述告诉我们，在我们的银河系中有一个知识系统，它是由Lyricus经过几千年的发展而形成的；Lyricus的教师采用 "边缘宇宙论 "中的材料，为人类发现大门户做准备；所有的星球和它们的居民都沿着类似的上升路径进化；Lyricus教师专注于 "主权整体和人类工具之间微妙的人类联系"。

关于人类文明的这种心理精神和社会转型如何展开的细节，至少可以说是微不足道的，但随着詹姆斯发布更多信息，他正在慢慢揭示。这些信息是理论和实践的混合体，通过wingmakers.com的各种媒介呈现，更直接地通过eventtemples.org的电子书呈现，现在可以通过这套书获得（见第二卷）。

根据 "极限宇宙论"，人类的转变和重新定义将通过粒子物理学和量子生物学的一个尚未揭示的汇合点发生。对无限意识（主权整体）和人类生命的多维性质的证明，将是这项即将到来的研究的最高成就。心理学家和意识研究者迪安-雷丁（Dean Radin）在他的《纠缠的心灵》一书中暗示了科学研究的这一新方向。

"我们看得越多，我们就越能在生物学中发现量子效应。不仅仅是小打小闹，而是基本的过程，如果没有量子连接，就根本不会存在。稍后，我们会发现这些效应在神经系统中运行，随后在大脑中运行。到那时，psi将从边缘变成主流，然后所有那些研究了一个多世纪却不为人知的奇怪现象将被接受，并被视为只是稍微领先于他们的时代。

正如本书介绍中简单提到的，大门户的发现是人类在更大的多元宇宙中进入其注定的生活的诞生。这是一个迷人的、令人振奋的想法，起初似乎与科幻文学中对人类探索宇宙的描述没有什么不同。然而，关键的区别在于超越物理层面的概念。这里有两个例子。

由于灵魂在其起源的超级宇宙中体验不同的空间环境，它也在多元宇宙中体验不同的维度和非空间环境，这些维度和非空间环境延伸到超级宇宙的物质结构之外。
一个特定星球的物种有一个独特的上升路径和进化轨道，以便成为一个跨维度的力量。[斜体字是我的]。
这里的关键短语是人类从 "行星动物到跨维力量 "的转变。本世纪的科学研究和发展将最终导致人类在多元宇宙中的新生活中诞生，其中对 "外部 "空间以及 "内部 "空间的探索将采取我们还无法想象的形式。

根据《极限宇宙论》，实现这一最终目标的一个必要组成部分是科学地区分灵魂（主权整体）和灵魂载体（也被称为人类工具）。灵魂载体包括我们的身体、情感、精神方面，以及遗传心灵。灵魂更难定义，但本质上它是个体的核心意识，是几个世纪以来冥想者经常描述的那种纯粹的自我意识。这种纯粹的自我意识也可以被描述为在思想产生之前经历的自我存在的感觉。它是存在于思想或感觉之间的心理空间。

实体或灵魂的词汇表条目将其描述为 "第一源的宇宙精神意识的片段。它是由一种非常精炼和纯净的能量振动组成的，与源头智慧（精神）相等"。在《极限宇宙论》提供的信息背景下，灵魂的发现是不折不扣的革命--它影响到文明的每一个部分。

大门的主要影响可以归结为三个主要影响因素。它们是：

科学、宗教和文化机构被重新格式化，以拥抱多维现实的科学作为其核心，指导频率。
政府领导人有义务重组他们的政治体系，以允许整合新的知识体系，特别是多维宇宙和生活在其中的智能生物的广泛兄弟关系。
与贸易和企业有关的社会机构被重新设计，以支持发现大门户后产生的技术。这些技术极大地改变了地球范围内的生活方式。这些技术包括灵魂载体的健康、物种延续的规划、生态系统的稳定和物种的协调，以服务于行星的教育系统。
很明显，从上面的描述来看，有大量与灵魂本质有关的知识，远远超出了宗教、哲学和心理学的理论。

接上先前的话题，科幻小说长期以来一直在描述人类探索和殖民太空以及我们发现地外生命形式的想法。具体到《极限宇宙论》，以及一般的书面材料，将这个概念从宇宙探索带到了多元宇宙探索。不仅人类和其他生命形式存在于时空维度中，而且其他维度的生命种族也存在。因此，LTO的观点将生命的边界扩展到物理宇宙之外，进入形而上学的多元宇宙。今天的天体物理学的宇宙学将让位于天体形而上学的新宇宙学。我们不仅会发现地外生命，也许更重要的是，我们会发现维外生命。

边缘宇宙论》节选
下面是一系列摘录自一个未发表的文本，称为。边缘宇宙论》（Liminal Cosmogony）。这个记录是银河系支流区所包含的知识系统的一部分。尽管所使用的词汇并不总是与WingMakers的词汇表一致，但翻译还是尽可能的精确。当这种情况发生时，是因为这些特殊的记录不是针对行星或物种的，因此，没有像WingMakers的材料那样被简化为人类或地球的术语。

莱里库斯的身份

Lyricus教学团起源于第七个超级宇宙的中央种族。在中央种族中，有一个次种族被象征性地称为造翼者。在WingMakers中，有一个特定的生命秩序被统称为Lyricus，正是这个群体负责组装和输出必要的知识库，以科学地证明灵魂的存在，并建立多维现实的科学，作为该物种的核心知识系统。

这种进化的结果是普遍的，而且在最广泛的程度上，对所有基于中央种族的生物遗传模板的物种都是一样的，被称为第一源的独立意识的第七原型灵魂载体。正是Lyricus负责引导一个发展中的物种达到技术和科学能力，从而使灵魂和灵魂载体被整个物种所区分和承认。

品种的发展

中央种族是一个古老的种族，基于与第七超级宇宙中其他地方的类人生命相同的基因模板。这个模板是相互联系的，并不是在进化的规模上，而是在密度的规模上发生关系。在第七个超级宇宙中，一个星球的振动密度在所有其他星球中是独一无二的，正是这种振动条件规定了生物遗传模板的特征，从而规定了它的倾向性和能力。

最高等级的灵魂载体并不比最低等级的灵魂载体更进化--因为它们的功能目的完全相同，只是振动速度不同。事实上，在许多方面，为密集振动而设计的灵魂载体比为中央宇宙更稀疏的振动而设计的灵魂载体更复杂、更进化。每个灵魂载体都是一个不间断的生物遗传结构链的一部分，每个生物遗传结构都是基于相同的可配置模板，使个体意识能够在近乎无限的有机和合成星球及空间环境中进行互动。

居住在高阶灵魂载体上的灵魂通常比居住在为更密集的振动而设计的灵魂载体上的灵魂更有经验，但这是一种概括，而不是一种规则。由于灵魂在其起源的超级宇宙中经历了不同的空间环境，它也在超越超级宇宙物质结构的多元宇宙中经历不同的维度和非空间环境。

物理空间要求灵魂--它是非物理的--被带入保护、感知和互动的工具中。正是通过这层感知和表达的膜，灵魂可以改变物理环境，并在这个过程中改变自己。正是个体意识和物种灵魂载体之间的这种能量交换，使物种能够从行星动物转变为跨维度的精神力量。

一个特定星球的物种有一个独特的升华路径和进化轨迹，以便成为一个跨维度的力量。这通过三种主要表现形式发生。

物种作为一个整体，学会了如何将灵魂载体与个体意识相融合，并将灵魂载体作为个体意识的综合延伸来运作。当这种情况发生时，灵魂载体在振动上被转移到与灵魂共鸣，而这种能力--在物种层面--是作为发现大门户的结果而出现的。
该物种被吸纳为超级宇宙网络的成员，并在其空间区域内与大门户后的物种建立了沟通线路。
该物种通过多维现实的科学，能够以负责任的管理方式管理其星球和互补的生命形式，并以非暴力的姿态抵御非互补的生命形式。
这些能力和条件必须在物种中汇聚，然后才允许它作为一个集体力量进行跨维度的运作。每个物种，或者更具体地说，中央种族的亚种，最终都要回到它的起源。在这种情况下，它的起源被灌输在灵魂载体编码或DNA的深处。找到物种的真正起源是一种不可磨灭的本能，而大门户的发现提供了第一个可证实的证据，将该物种与一个更大的兄弟会联系起来，其血统是外星的。

Lyricus教学团并不像教师在课堂上向学生传播知识那样公开传播这些知识。每个星球都有一个来自Lyricus的教师委员会，他们在特定的时间内化身为该物种和其母星，以便在大门户的方向上建立知识的引导。

一个物种的伟大发明和启示最常被赋予一个人，他不是想法的真正发起者，但却是集合了资源使想法成为知识标准的人。Lyricus行星理事会将知识的种子悄悄地传给了这个物种更伟大的思想，但他们自己却一直处于被认可的阴影之中。这就是引导该物种发展其行星通信网络的方式，这也是发现大门户的基础。

Lyricus的外在信息披露

Lyricus的教义只有在通信网络可以进入私人住宅、技术足够安全以防止被扣押、政治系统足够开放以防止审查、宿主环境足够信任以防止修改的阶段，才会在该物种内成为外显的教义。当这些条件得到满足时，Lyricus的教义就会通过最终作为其知识系统传播中心的网络被带到这个物种。

一般来说，这些教义会在几个 "印象 "中被提出来。首先是正式宣布它的到来，并让更多参与其中的工人网络看到--无论多么重要--发现大门户。这通常发生在第三代前驱体；然而，在某些物种中，它更早或更晚一代。

在这第一次介绍中，Lyricus的教义被从根本上描绘和阐明。这包括话语、宇宙学和激活资源。激活资源是编码的感官数据流，由Lyricus教师翻译成媒体格式和该物种普遍存在的感官系统。

教义的第二印象是提供给被认定为发现大门户的建筑师的特定学生。这些教义在本质上越来越深奥，专门与多维现实的新科学有关，将作为发现大门户的基石。

由于媒体和通信网络的不成熟，数据流及其激活的影响减少，因此激活资源最初是沉默的。随着网络的发展，更多的数据可以被嵌入，激活资源变得更加有力。这一般发生在第二代前体期间。

当激活材料的核心频率被提炼成一种可以诱导灵魂载体的心脑系统的技术时，Lyricus教义的第三个印象就出现了。这种强化的激活技术使那些与大门户的发现及其传播有关的特定功能化身的人能够抵制机构的自然惰性和恐惧反应。

正是这些人--他们中的许多人从Lyricus化身而来--将领导物种灵魂的发现，同样重要的是，将这一突破传播到发现后产生的新机构中。

Lyricus教义的第四个也是最后一个印象发生在大门户的发现之后，并确立了大门户在精神进步和教育系统领域对物种要求的应用。后者是四个印象中最关键的因素，因为它能使知识跨代延续。由于有三代前驱者揭示了大门户，一般也有三代后驱者将大门户的发现传递和扩散到物种的社会、文化、政治和科学机构。

大门发现前后的时间是最关键的，因为在这个时间点上，最容易出现修改、压制和彻底征服其发现的结果的情况。研究结果发布给公众监督的方式是至关重要的，Lyricus已经开发了一套精确的协议，以帮助提高这种传输的效率和效果。

大门户网站的调查结果

尽管这些协议很有效，但在有些情况下，大门户的发现被既有的机构成功地压制住了，这些机构预感到他们在这一发现的曙光中会被毁灭或取代。这种恐惧反应是感知位移的自然结果，这就是为什么Lyricus专门研究变革管理的心理学，以及为什么传输协议是如此严格地测试和完善。

大门户的主要发现可以归结为四个基本的知识体系。这些系统的效果描述如下。

灵魂载体的功能被削弱或减弱，与物种对灵魂的认知成正比的共鸣。
该物种在多个层面上是统一的，超越了时间和地点。这种统一对其充满活力的生存以及作为一种精神力量的升华途径至关重要，这种精神力量使该物种所定义的知识具有活力并得到保存。
该物种与一个庞大的相关生命形式网络有着先天的联系，每一个都是基于中央种族的生物遗传灵魂载体原型，具体到其超宇宙。总体而言，这些物种代表了第一源的细胞结构，而个体意识代表了其中不可分割的粒子。
个体化的意识是由物种策划的，以产生一条知识之路，将物种引向它的创造者和维护者。正是这种回归，就像一个被猛烈的尾风所驱使的迁徙之旅，被大门户加速了。
个人不是存在的，也不是真正独立于物种的。个人不是最高的，也不是意识的回报。个人与其说是第一源泉的人工制品，不如说是物种的人工制品。灵魂载体最终被转化并与个体意识融合，以至于它作为意识的一个独立组成部分而难以辨认，但个体仍然致力于物种的原型。

大门户的意义和影响

大门的主要影响可以归结为三个主要影响因素。它们是：

科学、宗教和文化机构被重新格式化，以拥抱多维现实的科学作为其核心，指导频率。
政府领导人有义务重组他们的政治体系，以允许整合新的知识体系，特别是多维宇宙和生活在其中的智能生物的广泛兄弟关系。
与贸易和企业有关的社会机构被重新设计，以支持发现大门户后产生的技术。这些技术极大地改变了地球范围内的生活方式。这些技术包括灵魂载体的健康、物种延续的规划、生态系统的稳定和物种的协调，以服务于行星的教育系统。
对大门户的抵抗

大门的阻力领域即使不能避免也是可以预见的。抵抗主要是以三个基本因素为前提。

粒子能源是否被用作武器和/或能源资源？
宗教是零散的还是统一的？
机器智能是由物种的智能管理的吗？
社会-政治抵抗

因为粒子能量是发现大门户的核心组成部分，所以该物种在发现大门户之前就已经意识到了粒子能量的内在力量。这种意识可以为能源生产提供无限的资源，也可以成为夺取行星资源控制权的胁迫性武器。

如果这个物种在自己的成员中使用粒子能量作为恐吓的武器，那么它就更有可能抵制大门户的接近，因为大门户的发现引入了一系列无可争议的智能生命形式，而这些生命形式的关系最初是不确定的。由于这种被认为是至高无上的平衡的转变，大门户的证据被抵制，并且有一个全面的策略来掩盖它。

宗教抵抗

在那些宗教和精神身份支离破碎的物种中，宗教领袖基本上是在竞争。也就是说，领导层选择了不同的方式来定义精神世界和其中的个人目的。这在部分激活了灵魂载体的感觉能力的物种中很常见。这种零散的能力正是精神领袖观点不一致的原因，而由此产生的竞争是精神领袖在发现大门户时表示抵抗的主要原因。

这种抵制最初一般以怀疑的形式出现，后来演变成愤慨和嘲讽。与社会和政治领袖不同的是，他们可以通过隐蔽的策略进行隐秘的操作，而精神领袖一般在发现和宣布大门户后会进行抵抗，而且是公开的抵抗。

技术阻力

随着物种进化其通信网络，机器智能开始侵蚀物种的智能。超级智能的机器被制造出来，如果不被物种适当地管理，它可以以比有机进化更快的速度自我进化，超越嵌入式管理协议，让机器主宰科学和技术的前沿。

当这种情况发生时，大门户仍然可以被发现，但这个物种本身并没有做好充分的准备来吸收这些发现，并将其应用于新机构的形成和现有机构的改造。当大门户仅由机器智能揭示时，其发现是空洞的，其传播通常是为该物种的智力精英所保留。

大门户的发现远没有向物种的教育机构和行星科学阶层扩散和传播其发现的意义大。这一发现为激活灵魂载体的感觉系统带来了希望，这是一个对物种具有重要价值的智能加速器。

那些既拥有分裂的精神身份，又将粒子能量作为武器部署的物种，是对大门户证据最抗拒的。通常情况下，这种抵抗有两个方面。

政治活动家们预测到了大门户发现的曙光，并在该发现被充分证实和证明是不可辩驳的之前就开始了掩盖它的策略。
当隐瞒的策略失败，证据被传播到网络上时，精神领袖们会进行下一波抵抗，怀疑那些负责发现证据的领袖的动机，因为所有或大多数人都不认同精神领袖所定义和/或坚持的信仰体系。
紧接着发现大门户之前的这段时间是最关键的。这段时期被称为 "证明期"，批评者将全力以赴，无拘无束地抵制大门户的影响，因为他们意识到--尽管可能很渺茫--巨大的变化破坏了他们的控制冲动。这是一个精神领袖和政治家联手击退这个错综复杂的形而上学和科学启示的时刻。

这就是为什么协议是由Lyricus精心设计的，以确保参与大门户发现的领导人熟练地操作，以确保抵抗是以智能反措施来进行的，以一种无法审查、改变或抑制的方式将人类灵魂的证据带到网络上。网络本身将以一种无法想象的方式揭示人类的灵魂，因此也是无法辩解的。

生命的模板

虽然Lyricus输出了一个物种的遗传模板，但该模板在结构上不是物理或物质的。在所有的空间维度上，存在着一个主要的振动场或量子优先权。这个场是非物理的，但为物理提供信息。它独立于存在的物理结构而存在，可以被认为是底层信息结构（UIS）。

UIS是亚量子的，代表了生命系统和无机物的主要蓝图。正是UIS催生了行星、恒星、星系和整个宇宙相互渗透的量子场。它是连接非局部和局部、个人和集体、一体和无限的生命通讯场。

Lyricus带来了在能量、量子水平上运行的主模板，并与UIS相互交融或坐落在一起，然后UIS作为所有主模板的能量网格。在主模板内有振动场和生物磁力，产生了所有维度的表达，包括物种或生物体的基因组及其相应的能量系统和联系、共振耦合和通信系统。

因此，Lyricus定义了一个物种或有机体的物理边界，而没有输出一个物理表征。相反，它被 "编程 "到量子水平的主模板中，这个主模板激活了子程序，最终形成了生物、有机系统或无机物的细胞智能或分子完整性。

物种通常在完全吸收和同化了从能量中出现的物理结构后，才会发现这些能量结构。有十一个主要的振动场，每个振动场都是直接与其他振动场相连接。它们不是在一个三维结构中分层。它们是全息盘绕和编码的，其方式无法用语言表达，也无法用三维几何或空间关系描述。

主模板是每个振动领域之间的共同界面。在能量上，它通过UIS得到支持和维持。UIS、主模板和由此产生的能量系统不断处于互动的交流过程中。正是这种交流为物种、有机体或物质对象--无论是有机还是无机--的进化设计提供了依据。

这种能量系统的互动过程由UIS的一个频率监控，该频率被称为源智能或宇宙精神智能。这个频率吸收、过滤和处理振动场之间的交流，并将其提炼成适合第一源头利用的信息包。这是所有存在的维度之间的互动被带入连贯性和适用性的方式，以形成新的世界、物种和维度结构。这是多元宇宙发展的渠道，其中的所有生命都在向更高维度的表达方式发展。

UIS提供了产生形式的量子场和能量系统以及支持形式的生命系统背后的结构。灵魂载体是主模板的一个结果，它在UIS的多元宇宙载体上被能量化地分配给有生命的星球。这个模板创造了灵魂的形态发生场并与之互动，定义了灵魂载体的功能和表达极限--但只是在时间流中。

灵魂的存在

灵魂载体处于不断变化和发展的状态，这是主模板、UIS和存在于每个细胞中的DNA分子之间跳舞的结果。随着物种的灵魂载体的进化，DNA分子越来越多地激活它的天线，并对更高维度的组织化信息场做出反应，使灵魂载体更充分地整合灵魂意识。

当灵魂意识以更大的振动力和整合力进入灵魂载体时，它振动地改变了灵魂载体。它一般以三种不同的方式做到这一点。

灵魂载体的能量中心（有时被称为脉轮）是UIS能量进入灵魂载体的渠道--在各个层面--身体上、情感上和精神上。这种UIS能量的增加在振动上转移了灵魂载体，使其更容易接触到灵魂的意识。
随着灵魂频率的进入，灵魂载体获得了一种欣赏和越来越多的认识，即它是与线性时间、结晶物质和三维空间的世界互动的神-碎片的载体波表达。这种新的认知预示着身份和价值的转变。
DNA分子既是调整UIS和主模板的天线，也是它与灵魂意识进一步亲密接触的结果，是其转变的传递者。这种传输是一种振动频率，可以传达给物种内所有其他人的DNA分子，甚至影响相关物种。
灵魂与UIS相适应，并在其中运作，因为这是其本质所固有的振动场。随着越来越多的物种体现出他们的灵魂意识，剩下的成员也会更容易这样做。

发展的转变

在大门户出现之前，有四个发展转变，这些转变一般在发现后的三到五代内发生。它们是按照以下顺序展开的。

行星环境和空间环境中表现出一种物理变化。这种物理变化象征着虚拟结构的重大变化，使人类为大门户做好准备。物理变化通常通过天气状况、天文异常、种族动荡、技术失调和疾病来表达，所有这些都影响到经济和行星的稳定。
情感的转变表现在物种的运动中，在能量的、非物理的层面上更有效地管理他们的情感中心（心脏），使心脏和大脑中心之间有更高的带宽连接。这种心脑连接使灵魂载体的能量中心保持一致，以接受更强烈地唤醒物种基因中天生存在的直觉力量。
由于之前心脑整合的转变，物种的遗传思维被更多的人接触到，这就表达了一种心理上的转变。遗传思维--作为物种定义的信息库--独立于水平时间流运作，如果其更高维度的信息包被访问，可以提供知识上的飞跃。
当遗传思维的网格变得不连续，形成多个分组时，遗传思维内部就会发生转变。该物种的成员将精力充沛地重组为共鸣组，每个人都能进入遗传思维的不同区域，并演化出一个不连续的子遗传思维，其共鸣耦合更适合于每个组。
这四个阶段依次发生，在时间上展开，为下一个阶段提供信息和催化，直到最终发现大门户。这种进展是在微妙、复杂和细致的过程中进行的，尽管表面上是混乱的，但更深层的有序系统占了上风，并对时间、空间和物质的表面效应进行约束。

在第四阶段结束时，UIS的能量和主模板的虚拟结构开始在行星的时间和空间维度内 "下降"，被物种的意识转变所吸引。那些被基因思维的高维区域所吸引的物种成员将在这段时间内揭示出多维现实的科学，它一直被编码在主模板中，等待思想和心灵的共鸣来揭开它。

大门户是全息的，从第一源头发出，延伸到UIS，嵌入到主模板中，传导到遗传思维的量子场中，吸引到灵魂载体的能量系统中，最后盘绕在物种的DNA分子中。这种能量、信息和表达方式的巧妙互换，是由环绕大门户的磁场协调的。

大门户类似于一个引力场，将周围所有的物质吸引到它的面前。这种存在以电磁方式释放到三维领域，从而成为一种召唤力，将一个物种通过时间和空间带到大门户，并通过它所代表的能量场。
