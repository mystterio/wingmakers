Lyricus Discourse 2
Calling Forth the Wholeness Navigator
 

Student: Is God a physical being?

Teacher: Are you?

Student: Of course.

Teacher: Then doesn’t it stand to reason that God is as well?

Student: I don’t know…

Teacher: Can a dead man govern a city?

Student: No.

Teacher: Then how does First Source govern the Grand Universe that is—at its most coarse expression—a physical manifestation?

Student: First Source inhabits a body like you and me?

Teacher: Can any person upon earth create something more magnificent than their human instrument?

Student: I can’t think of an instance.

Teacher: So, within this world, the human instrument is the highest expression of materiality?

Student: I think so.

Teacher: And whatever a human creates, its creation is less magnificent than it is.

Student: Unless it is a child.

Teacher: And who is the child of First Source?

Student: We are.

Teacher: No. Humans are thousands of generations removed from First Source. Who was the original child or first creation of God?

Student: I don’t know. Source Intelligence, or Spirit?

Teacher: Source Intelligence isn’t a creation of God; it is the mobility and presence of God.

Student: Then I’m afraid I don’t know.

Teacher: When a cloud emerges from a blue sky, there are specific conditions that create the cloud. It appears from the sky, but does not resemble the sky in color, scale, texture or scope. And yet, is it not accurate to say that the cloud was a child of the sky?

Student: I suppose, but what does this have to do with the physical body of God?

Teacher: Think of First Source as the sky, and the physical body of First Source as the cloud.
Student: So, the first child of God was the physical body of God?

Teacher: Yes.

Student: First Source created the conditions whereby its physical counterpart could manifest to govern the physical universe. Then which came first, the physical universe or the physical expression of God?

Teacher: Do you elect a president before you have a nation?

Student: Okay, I see your point. Is it true that we were created in the image of God?

Teacher: There are genetic archetypes that reside within the physical manifestation of God, and these archetypes are seven-fold.

Student: So there are seven manifestations of God? Are they all physical?

Teacher: They can be summoned physically at will, but God appears to each of his seven offspring in the form they will recognize as their father.

Student: Are you referring to the seven root races of earth?

Teacher: No. The seven races of humankind are part of the most ancient genetic line of the universe in which earth is an infinitesimal component. I’m referring to the seven genetic archetypes that reside within the Seven Tribes of Light that are known as the Central Race. They are sometimes referred to as the Elohim, Shining Ones, or WingMakers.

Student: And you’re saying that these beings are separated into seven genetic groups?

Teacher: The Grand Universe consists of seven universes, and each of these converges in the central-most region of the Grand Universe. It is within this region that the seven physical manifestations of First Source live, each an archetype of the human instrument designed for the universe of its destiny.

Student: Are you saying there are seven versions of God?

Teacher: There is only one God, but there are seven human instruments—each with different attributes and capabilities—that the one God inhabits. Our universe is associated with the Seventh Archetype, and it is this expression of First Source that interacts with, and governs, our universe.

Student: Are all seven universes like our own?

Teacher: The physical worlds are similar in all material respects, but the life forms that populate them possess different genetic capabilities, forms, and expressions, each based on the archetype of First Source.

Student: A human instrument from universe one would not be similar to a human instrument from any of the other six universes?

Teacher: Correct.

Student: But isn’t this true even within our own universe? Not all humanoid life forms look the same?

Teacher: This is not a matter of appearance. You are 98 percent identical to a chimpanzee—genetically speaking—and yet you undoubtedly consider yourself quite different in appearance.

Student: What you’re saying is that all humanoid life forms, regardless of where they are located within our universe, are genetically linked to the Seventh Archetype of First Source?
Teacher: Correct, but you can extend this to include a broad spectrum of other life forms as well. In other words, it’s not just the human instrument.

Student: Then in the other six universes, each has its own archetype that is embodied by God, and the life forms of these universes conform to this archetype—at least from a genetic perspective, if not in appearance. Is this accurate?

Teacher: Yes.

Student: Then the obvious question is why? Why does First Source divide itself into seven genetic universes?

Teacher: When you approach a vast mystery, a mystery as infinite as the Grand Universe, what do you, as the creator, desire above all other things?

Student: Assurance that the universes will not be destroyed.

Teacher: Assume that you have no doubt of this—so perfect is your plan.

Student: Then I would probably want to inhabit what I created and explore it.

Teacher: And how would you do this?

Student: I would need to travel somehow.

Teacher: Assume that you are the Seventh Archetype of First Source. You are alone in your universe, and the universe is populated only with celestial bodies. There are no sentient life forms and no method of travel.

Student: But isn’t that what Source Intelligence is for? Doesn’t First Source utilize Source Intelligence for its travel or omnipresence?

Teacher: Let me remind you that we are discussing a physical expression of God. The Seventh Archetype of First Source is not able to travel about the universe independent of the laws of the universe. You may think of these seven Archetypes as the Human Instruments of First Source, and attribute similar characteristics and limitations to them, as we ourselves must bear.

Student: So, the physical archetypes of First Source do not share the omnipresence and omniscience of their Father?

Teacher: They do not.

Student: Do they operate as a team, or are they independent?

Teacher: They operate in cooperation and collaboration, but they exercise their sovereign wills as it pertains to the universe under their charge.

Student: Were the archetypes of First Source created right after the creation of the Grand Universe?

Teacher: They were created in succession the same way a family is created.

Student: Why?

Teacher: There is much to learn from the creation of one that can be passed on to the next.

Student: I want to see if I understand this correctly. At some point in time there was a Grand Universe created by First Source, consisting of seven universes, each governed by a physical expression of First Source. The universes were devoid of life other than celestial bodies like stars and planets. Is this correct so far?

Teacher: Yes.

Student: And then the creation of life occurred. How?

Teacher: First Archetype of First Source created life forms, what we shall call the Central Race of First Universe. These beings were very powerful and not unlike their creator in function and form. They, in turn, created the genetic structures that became the first, pure physical soul carriers that housed the individuated spirit energies of First Source.

Student: And this repeated itself six more times?

Teacher: Each universe was populated with genetic structures that were based on the Archetype of First Source for that particular universe. Each genetic structure had unique capabilities that were suited for the exploration and colonization of their particular universe.

Student: So, there are seven different genetic structures of soul carriers exploring the Grand Universe. For what reason? Why does First Source design the universe this way?

Teacher: The Grand Universe is a vast network of life-bearing planets that enable the individuated spirit consciousness, housed within a soul carrier, or human instrument, to interact with the limitations that physical worlds—by their very structure—impose. By interacting with these limitations, the genetic structures evolve, and in this evolution, they become unified.

Student: Are you saying that evolution’s final form is unity?

Teacher: Not in all species, but in the most advanced formats of physical existence, unity is the outcome of evolution.

Student: Why?

Teacher: When you create something that is in your image, what do you think is the most difficult thing to do?

Student: Let it go?

Teacher: Correct. You want your creation to explore and colonize the universe, but you also want your creation to return. Thus, you instill a fundamental instinct within your creation to desire to return to their place of origin. This is the unification instinct and it is one of the most powerful instincts designed into the soul carriers, of which the human instrument is one.

Student: Then human-like, soul carriers exist throughout the Grand Universe, and all of them are designed to explore the expanding universe, but also to return to the central-most region after they’re done. This doesn’t make a lot of sense.

Teacher: It is not the soul carriers that return. These are physical-based vehicles that, like all physical matter, decay and transform. Only the Wholeness Navigator within the soul carrier neither decays nor transforms. It remains everlasting, and within this specific element of humanity it is designed to return to its origins.

Student: Where does one draw the line between First Source and other life forms?

Teacher: How do you mean this?

Student: Are the Archetypes of First Source separate from First Source. In other words, do they have their own identity, or do they think of themselves as First Source? In the same way, what about the Central Race?

Teacher: There are five rings of life that comprise First Source. At the center is the consciousness of First Source. At the whole is Source Intelligence. In between are three rings of life: the seven Archetypes of First Source, the Central Race, and the individuated spirit-essence, or Wholeness Navigator.

Student: And each of these rings of life draws their identity from First Source?

Teacher: Yes.

Student: What you’re really saying is that all of these life forms are threaded together as one consciousness?

Teacher: No more than a family is one consciousness.

Student: They are separate?

Teacher: They are both separate and unified.

Student: How?

Teacher: The five rings of life are distinct forms of consciousness. In the formless state, each ring of life is aware of its unity, purpose, and inherent kinship with the others. In the physical realms, where consciousness is expressed through a dimensionally focused soul-carrier, they have a diminished awareness of this connection. Thus, they are both separate and unified, depending upon which strata of consciousness the entity is focused.

Student: Then you’re saying that even the Archetypes of First Source, since they have a physical body, operate in the three-dimensional world without a strong sense of connection to First Source? It hardly seems possible.

Teacher: No one within the Central Race pretends to know the degree in which the Archetypes of First Source have a diminished capacity to recall their Source vibration. However, those within the Central Race are well aware of how the soul carriers of three-dimensional substance, create the condition of separation in which divine recall is reduced to such a degree that the entity regards itself as separate from First Source, and therefore its capabilities.

Student: Separate from the capabilities of First Source?

Teacher: If you believe you are an ant, how do you behave differently than an eagle?

Student: But an ant is not an eagle.

Teacher: But the Wholeness Navigator is First Source. If the ant were an eagle, in every respect except form, but associated its capabilities with that of an ant, the eagle would slowly lose its ability to fly, it’s entire physical body, mind, and emotional make-up would change. Its soul carrier would literally devolve.

Student: Our bodies cause our souls to devolve?

Teacher: No. Our sense of separation from our Source vibration causes our human instrument to remain devolved. The devolution has already occurred; it is merely perpetuated.

Student: Then the goal is to awaken this Source vibration and begin to re-associate with its divinity—this is what causes the human instrument to evolve in the direction of the Wholeness Navigator?

Teacher: If you are going to start a fire, what do you need?

Student: Dry wood, kindling, and a lot of work generating sufficient heat to combust the kindling.

Teacher: And what is the most critical of these?

Student: I suppose the kindling.

Teacher: Can you start a fire without any of the elements?

Student: No.

Teacher: Are you sure?

Student: Well, I could start a fire with the kindling, but without the dry wood, it won’t last very long.

Teacher: Aren’t they all critical then?

Student: Yes.

Teacher: And if I had all the critical components to start a fire, but I had no experience, would I be able to produce fire?

Student: Probably not.

Teacher: I might not even know, if someone were to give me all of these items, that their purpose was to create a fire. Correct?

Student: Correct.

Teacher: So we can add experiential knowledge as a critical component.

Student: Yes.

Teacher: And what if I didn’t see the need for a fire?

Student: Okay, so you also need a reason or desire.

Teacher: Yes. Desire and purpose are critical.

Student: Okay, I agree we can add that to our expanding list.

Teacher: And if we were outside and it was raining and our kindling became wet—

Student: I understand, conditions must be right.

Teacher: So conditions are important also?

Student: Yes, but where are you going with this? I don’t understand how this applies to my question about what causes the Wholeness Navigator to evolve?

Teacher: You simplified your question to the extreme. The equations of evolution are so complex that they are invisible to the mind of the human instrument. It is not merely the re-association with the Source vibration or God-Fragment that draws the Wholeness Navigator to it divinity and re-asserts its capabilities as a replica of First Source. This equation carries thousands upon thousands of critical elements bundled in a coherent, carefully orchestrated path. I wanted you to remember this.

Student: But isn’t it necessary to simplify in order to approach the subject? How can anyone give all of these factors equal weight and still have an intelligent discussion?

Teacher: That’s my point. You cannot.

Student: So we can’t even discuss it?

Teacher: No, not with any degree of accuracy. Evolutionary circuits are dependent on complex systems, and these systems are so vast and multifaceted that words—when applied to depict them—only serve to bring focus on one element and this element is never—in itself—powerful enough to catalyze or mobilize the evolutionary path.

Student: So what does?

Teacher: If you had a magical friend that was infallible in her judgment; perfect in her decisions because she saw clear to the destination of First Source and therefore knew how to travel the landscape to achieve her reunion with God. What would you do with this friend?

Student: I’d listen to them. I’d ask them for directions and guidance. I’d follow as closely behind them as I could.

Teacher: Even if they led you to a cliff and jumped off.

Student: Well, if I really believed they had this infallible judgment as you put it, yes, even if they jumped off a cliff. Somehow I’d trust that I would be okay if I followed them over.

Teacher: What if they didn’t know you were following and they had capabilities that you did not? In this example, they could fly, but you could not.

Student: I guess I would have made a terrible mistake in following them, and I’d die as a result.

Teacher: So your friend’s judgment, even though it was infallible for herself, led to your own destruction.

Student: Yes.

Teacher: So who then do you offer your trust to?

Student: Myself.

Teacher: And why?

Student: Because I know my own limitations.

Teacher: So what do you think is the mobilizing factor for one’s evolutionary path to Wholeness and unity?

Student: You mean if I could sum it up in a single concept—despite the fact you showed me earlier that it couldn’t be done?

Teacher: You’re learning very well.

Student: It would be to trust myself.

Teacher: What part of your self?

Student: The soul.

Teacher: And not the carrier?

Student: Okay, I would need to trust the whole of me.

Teacher: Trust the parts and the whole. Trust the connection of these to First Source. Trust the God-Fragment that orchestrates all of this complexity into coherent experience and knowledge that assures the recollection of your divinity. Trust the evolutionary process defined by First Source. Trust each of these above the external voices that meet you, no matter how infallible they may appear to be. Trust your self-knowing and its ability to guide you in the ascending spiral of your journey.

Student: Even though I am but a student?

Teacher: Are we not all students?

Student: But there are those who know more than me. I don’t feel like I know that much to trust myself. How can I overcome this self-doubt?

Teacher: It is not something to overcome. If it were, would you then require trust?

Student: I suppose not.

Teacher: When you grapple with the finer distinctions of a concept, you invariably come to a wall that defines the limits of your memory or experience. When you find this wall, there is nothing wrong with seeking help from others, but remember that you are the entity that is most aware of your own needs. The wall that you find may be precisely what you need at that time.

Student: Then it seems that I need to become more aware of my self-interests and needs.

Teacher: The needs that you have that fuel your evolution as a Sovereign Integral. If you are hungry, your stomach will remind you. If you are tired, you will yawn and your eyelids will become unbearably heavy. What is the equivalent for your evolution as a Sovereign Integral?

Student: It’s an interesting question. I don’t know.

Teacher: What causes you to search for your higher self?

Student: I guess unanswered questions. Not knowing who I am, where I am going or why I am here.

Teacher: Really? Unanswered questions awaken you to your highest self-interests?

Student: I can tell by your question that I answered wrong. What is it then?

Teacher: It is inspiration! Inspiration from the spiritual masters who came before you.Inspiration from Nature.Inspiration from art. But most importantly, it is the inspiration that enters from the realm of the Wholeness Navigator within you, into your human instrument and then tirelessly kindles your desire to recollect the reality of the God-Fragment stored inside you.

Student: How do I recognize this inspiration?

Teacher: It is not important to recognize it. It only matters that you feel it and welcome its presence because this is how you develop self-trust and self-knowing.

Student: Are there techniques to accomplish this?

Teacher: Of course.

Student: What are they?

Teacher: You haven’t invented them yet?

Student: I thought you might know some that you could share.

Teacher: I know my own. I do not know yours.

Student: They’re different for everyone?

Teacher: I don’t know.

Student: How did you create your own techniques?

Teacher: If you want to establish a relationship with someone that you want to know, what are some of the things you do?

Student: I might invite them for a conversation over tea, or possibly write them an introductory letter describing my wish to meet them.

Teacher: And if they don’t respond.

Student: I will probably assume that they are too busy, or more likely, not interested in meeting me.

Teacher: Then this is the problem.

Student: What?

Teacher: The human instrument gives up too easy, if it invites the Wholeness Navigator into its realm at all.

Student: I think we’re all sensitive to rejection.

Teacher: Do you think it’s possible to be rejected by the divine instruments of First Source?

Student: I never thought about it before. Maybe?

Teacher: It is not. The divine instruments of First Source are ever vigilant for sincere prayers, and never reject the offer to extend their presence within the human instrument of an entity that desires to ascend in consciousness. This is an immutable law of the universe.

Student: Is there a better way to extend this invitation than simply asking in prayer?

Teacher: It is not your words that will be heard. It is your feelings and the purity of their motivation. You could be drunk from wine and swearing in your loudest voice, but if your innermost feelings were pure, sincere, humble, and motivated by love, your invitation would be answered. In contrast, you could be meditating for days, striving to be of perfect character, and asking in the quietest whisper of a clear mind, but if you were tainted with the motivations of honor and pride, your invitation would most likely be declined.

Student: Why would the Wholeness Navigator, or any divine instrument of First Source, care?

Teacher: Why do you care if the food you eat is served on a clean plate or a dirty floor?

Student: I don’t understand the comparison.

Teacher: The human instrument is a vessel, or soul carrier. Upon your planet, it houses the pure and perfect instrument of First Source: the Wholeness Navigator. If the human instrument is impure with thoughts of materiality, motivations of self-aggrandizement or actions of hatred, it makes the soul carrier less receptive to the vibrations of the Wholeness Navigator. In some cases, the Wholeness Navigator, if it enters into such a vessel and offers its capabilities, these very capabilities are corrupted for selfish purposes.

Student: So the Wholeness Navigator does not want its capabilities to become contaminated by an impure soul carrier?

Teacher: This is partially true, but it is more that the God-Fragment within you chooses to expose its energies to a human instrument that has invited it to share its vision and understanding. Once it is invited, it will monitor the response of the human instrument to its presence. If the invitations are repeatedly extended, the God-Fragment will continue to materialize as an infused, spirit-led consciousness that directs the human instrument in its earthly mission.

Student: It sounds like the God-Fragment takes over. Is that how it is?

Teacher: The God-Fragment injects divine perspective into the human instrument. It enables the soul carrier to become the soul’s vision in service to First Source. In doing this, the human instrument is transformed.

Student: I understand. I think I need some time to sort all this out. Thank you for sharing your perspective and helping me with my understanding.

Teacher: You are very welcome.

莱里库斯论述2
呼唤完整的导航者
 

学生。上帝是一个物理存在吗？

老师。你是吗？

学生。当然。

老师。那么上帝也是如此，这不是很合理吗？

学生。我不知道...

老师。一个死人可以管理一个城市吗？

学生。没有。

老师。那么第一源头是如何管理这个大宇宙的--以其最粗略的表达方式--物理表现？

学生。第一源头像你和我一样居住在一个身体里？

老师。世上有谁能创造出比他们的人类工具更宏伟的东西？

学生。我想不出一个例子。

老师。所以，在这个世界上，人的工具是物质性的最高表现？

学生。我想是的。

老师。无论人类创造什么，它的创造都没有它那么宏伟。

学生。除非是一个孩子。

老师。那么谁是第一源的孩子呢？

学生。我们是。

老师。不，人类与第一源头相差几千代。谁是上帝最初的孩子或第一个创造物？

学生。我不知道。源头智慧，还是精神？

老师。源智能不是上帝的创造物，它是上帝的流动性和存在。

学生。那我恐怕不知道。

老师。当一朵云从蓝天中出现时，有一些特定的条件造就了这朵云。它从天空中出现，但在颜色、规模、质地或范围上与天空并不相似。然而，说云是天空的孩子，这难道不准确吗？

学生。我想，但这与上帝的肉体有什么关系？

老师。把第一源泉想象成天空，把第一源泉的肉体想象成云。
学生。那么，上帝的第一个孩子是上帝的肉体？

老师。是的。

学生。首先源头创造了条件，使它的物理对应物能够显现出来，以管理物理宇宙。那么哪一个先出现，是物理宇宙还是上帝的物理表达？

老师。在有国家之前，你会选出一个总统吗？

学生。好的，我明白你的意思。我们是按照上帝的形象创造的，这是真的吗？

老师。有一些遗传原型居住在神的物理表现中，这些原型有七个方面。

学生。那么上帝有七种表现形式？它们都是实物吗？

老师。他们可以随心所欲地被召唤出来，但上帝是以他们承认为父亲的形式出现在他的七个后代中的每一个。

学生。你指的是地球上的七个根源种族吗？

老师。不，人类的七个种族是宇宙中最古老的遗传线的一部分，地球是其中的一个无限小的组成部分。我指的是居住在被称为中央种族的七个光明部落中的七个基因原型。他们有时被称为Elohim、Shining Ones或WingMakers。

学生。你是说，这些生命被分成七个基因组？

老师。大宇宙由七个宇宙组成，每个宇宙都汇聚在大宇宙的最中心区域。第一源泉的七个实体表现就生活在这个区域内，每个都是为其命运的宇宙设计的人类工具的原型。

学生。你是说有七个版本的上帝？

老师。只有一个上帝，但有七个人类工具--每个都有不同的属性和能力--由一个上帝居住。我们的宇宙与第七个原型有关，正是这种第一源泉的表达方式与我们的宇宙互动，并对其进行管理。

学生。七个宇宙都像我们的宇宙吗？

老师。物质世界在所有物质方面都是相似的，但居住在其中的生命形式拥有不同的遗传能力、形式和表达方式，每一个都是基于第一源的原型。

学生。一个来自宇宙一的人类仪器不会与来自其他六个宇宙的人类仪器相似？

老师。正确。

学生。但即使在我们自己的宇宙中，这不也是真的吗？不是所有的人形生物都长得一样？

老师。这不是一个外表的问题。你和黑猩猩有98%的相同之处--从基因上讲--但你无疑认为自己在外表上有很大不同。

学生。你的意思是，所有的类人生命形式，无论它们在我们的宇宙中位于何处，都与第一源头的第七原型有基因联系？
老师。正确，但你也可以把它扩展到包括其他广泛的生命形式。换句话说，这不仅仅是人类的工具。

学生。那么在其他六个宇宙中，每个宇宙都有自己的原型，由神来体现，这些宇宙的生命形式符合这个原型--至少从遗传的角度，如果不是从外观上。这是否准确？

老师。是的。

学生。那么明显的问题是为什么？为什么第一源泉要把自己分成七个基因宇宙？

老师。当你接近一个巨大的谜团，一个像大宇宙一样无限的谜团时，作为创造者，你渴望什么，高于其他一切？

学生。保证各宇宙不会被摧毁。

老师。假设你对此毫不怀疑--你的计划是如此完美。

学生。那么我可能会想居住在我创造的东西里，并探索它。

老师。那你会怎么做呢？

学生。我将需要以某种方式旅行。

老师。假设你是第一源头的第七个原型。你在你的宇宙中是孤独的，宇宙中只有天体的存在。没有有知觉的生命形式，也没有旅行的方法。

学生。但这不正是源泉智能的作用吗？第一源泉不是利用源泉智能来实现其旅行或无所不在吗？

老师。让我提醒你，我们讨论的是神的物理表达。第一源泉的第七个原型不能独立于宇宙的规律在宇宙中旅行。你可以把这七个原型看作是第一源泉的人类工具，并把类似的特征和限制归于他们，因为我们自己必须承担。

学生。那么，第一源泉的物理原型并不分享他们父亲的无所不在和无所不知？

老师。他们不这样做。

学生。他们是作为一个团队运作，还是独立运作？

老师。他们在合作和协作中运作，但他们行使自己的主权意志，因为这与他们所负责的宇宙有关。

学生。第一源泉的原型是在大宇宙创建之后立即创建的吗？

老师。他们被连续创造，就像一个家庭被创造的方式一样。

学生。为什么？

老师。从一个人的创作中可以学到很多东西，可以传给下一代。

学生。我想看看我的理解是否正确。在某个时间点，有一个由第一源泉创造的大宇宙，由七个宇宙组成，每个宇宙都由第一源泉的物理表达来管理。除了恒星和行星等天体外，这些宇宙没有任何生命。到目前为止，这是否正确？

老师。是的。

学生。然后就发生了生命的创造。怎么会这样？

老师。第一源头的第一个原型创造了生命形式，我们将称之为第一宇宙的中央种族。这些生命非常强大，在功能和形式上与他们的创造者并无不同。他们反过来又创造了遗传结构，成为第一个纯粹的物理灵魂载体，容纳了第一源的个体化精神能量。

学生。而这又重复了六次？

老师。每个宇宙都有基于该特定宇宙的第一源头原型的基因结构。每个基因结构都有独特的能力，适合在其特定的宇宙中进行探索和殖民。

学生。所以，有七种不同基因结构的灵魂载体在大宇宙中探索。出于什么原因？为什么第一源泉要这样设计宇宙？

老师。大宇宙是一个巨大的承载生命的星球网络，它使容纳在灵魂载体或人类工具中的个体精神意识能够与物理世界的结构所带来的限制进行互动。通过与这些限制的互动，遗传结构不断进化，在这种进化中，它们变得统一起来。

学生。你是说，进化的最终形式是统一的吗？

老师。不是在所有物种中，而是在最先进的物质存在形式中，团结是进化的结果。

学生。为什么？

老师。当你创造出有你形象的东西时，你认为最难做的是什么？

学生。让它去吧？

老师。正确。你希望你的创造物能够探索和殖民宇宙，但你也希望你的创造物能够返回。因此，你在你的创造物中灌输了一种基本的本能，渴望回到他们的起源地。这是统一的本能，它是设计在灵魂载体上的最强大的本能之一，人类的工具就是其中之一。

学生。那么在整个大宇宙中都存在类似人类的灵魂载体，它们都被设计来探索不断扩张的宇宙，但也会在完成后返回最中心的区域。这没有什么意义。

老师：返回的不是灵魂载体。这些是基于物理的载体，像所有的物理物质一样，会腐烂和转化。只有灵魂载体中的 "整体性领航者 "既不腐烂也不转化。它仍然是永恒的，在人类的这个特定元素中，它被设计为回到它的本源。

学生。第一来源和其他生命形式之间的界限在哪里？

老师：你这话是什么意思？

学生。第一源泉的原型是否与第一源泉分开。换句话说，他们有自己的身份，还是认为自己是第一源泉？以同样的方式，中央种族呢？

老师。有五个生命之环组成第一源。在中心是第一源泉的意识。在整体上是源头智慧。在两者之间有三个生命环：第一源泉的七个原型，中央种族，以及个体化的精神本质，即整体性导航者。

学生。而这些生命之环中的每一个都从第一源头汲取它们的身份？

老师。是的。

学生。你真正想说的是，所有这些生命形式作为一个意识被串联起来？

老师。不超过一个家庭是一个意识。

学生。它们是分开的？

老师。它们既是独立的，又是统一的。

学生。如何？

老师。生命的五个环是意识的不同形式。在无形的状态下，每个生命环都意识到自己的统一性、目的性和与其他生命环的内在亲缘关系。在物质世界中，意识是通过一个维度的灵魂载体来表达的，它们对这种联系的意识有所减弱。因此，它们既是独立的，又是统一的，这取决于实体的意识集中在哪个层面上。

学生。那么你是说，即使是第一源泉的原型，因为他们有一个肉体，所以在三维世界中运作时没有与第一源泉的强烈联系感？这似乎不可能。

老师。在中央种族中，没有人假装知道第一源的原型在多大程度上有回顾其源振动的能力减弱。然而，中央种族的人很清楚，三维物质的灵魂载体是如何创造出分离的条件的，在这种条件下，神圣的回忆被降低到如此程度，以至于实体认为自己与第一源头是分离的，因此它的能力也是分离的。

学生。与第一资源的能力分开？

教师：如果你相信自己是一只蚂蚁，你的行为与老鹰有什么不同？

学生。但蚂蚁不是鹰。

老师。但整体性的导航者是第一源泉。如果蚂蚁是一只鹰，除了外形之外，其他方面都是鹰，但把它的能力与蚂蚁的能力联系起来，鹰就会慢慢失去飞行的能力，它的整个身体、思想和情感构成都会改变。它的灵魂载体将从字面上发生变化。

学生。我们的身体导致我们的灵魂堕落？

老师。我们与源头振动的分离感导致我们的人类工具继续退化。转化已经发生了；它只是被延续了。

学生。那么目标是唤醒这个源头振动，并开始与它的神性重新联系起来--这就是导致人类工具向整体性导航仪方向发展的原因？

老师：如果你要生火，你需要什么？

学生。干燥的木头，火种，以及大量的工作产生足够的热量来燃烧火种。

老师。而其中最关键的是什么？

学生。我想是火种。

老师。没有任何元素，你能生火吗？

学生。没有。

老师。你确定吗？

学生。好吧，我可以用火种生火，但是如果没有干木头，火就不会持续很久。

老师。那他们不是都很关键吗？

学生。是的。

老师。如果我有所有启动火的关键部件，但我没有经验，我能够产生火吗？

学生。可能不会。

老师：如果有人给我所有这些物品，我可能都不知道它们的目的是为了制造火灾。对吗？

学生。正确。

老师。所以我们可以把体验式知识作为一个重要的组成部分加入。

学生。是的。

老师。如果我不认为有必要发生火灾呢？

学生。好的，所以你还需要一个理由或愿望。

老师。是的。欲望和目的是关键。

学生。好的，我同意我们可以把它添加到我们的扩展列表中。

老师。如果我们在外面，下着雨，我们的火种被打湿了------。

学生。我明白，条件必须是正确的。

老师。所以条件也很重要？

学生。是的，但你想说什么呢？我不明白这如何适用于我的问题，即是什么导致了整体性导航仪的发展？

老师。你把你的问题简化到了极致。进化的方程式是如此复杂，以至于人类工具的思维无法看到它们。它不仅仅是与源振动或上帝碎片的重新关联，它吸引了整体性导航仪的神性，并重新确认了它作为第一源的复制品的能力。这个等式包含了成千上万的关键因素，被捆绑在一个连贯的、精心安排的路径中。我希望你能记住这一点。

学生。但是，为了接近这个主题，难道不需要简化吗？怎么可能有人对所有这些因素给予同等的重视，而且还能进行明智的讨论？

老师。这就是我的观点。你不能。

学生。所以我们甚至不能讨论它？

老师。不，不具有任何程度的准确性。进化的回路依赖于复杂的系统，而这些系统是如此的庞大和多面，以至于用文字来描述它们时，只能使人们把注意力集中在一个元素上，而这个元素本身从来就不足以催化或调动进化的道路。

学生。那么是什么呢？

老师：如果你有一个神奇的朋友，她的判断力是无懈可击的；她的决定是完美的，因为她清楚地看到了第一源头的目的地，因此知道如何穿越风景来实现她与神的重逢。你会对这个朋友做什么？

学生。我会倾听他们的意见。我会向他们询问方向和指导。我会尽可能地紧跟在他们后面。

老师。即使他们把你带到悬崖边上，然后跳下去。

学生。好吧，如果我真的相信他们有你所说的这种无懈可击的判断，是的，即使他们跳下悬崖。不知怎的，我相信如果我跟着他们过去，我就会没事。

老师。如果他们不知道你在跟踪，而且他们有你没有的能力，那怎么办？在这个例子中，他们能飞，而你却不能。

学生。我想我跟着他们会犯一个可怕的错误，我会因此而死。

老师。所以你朋友的判断，尽管对她自己来说是无懈可击的，却导致了你自己的毁灭。

学生。是的。

老师。那么，你向谁提供你的信任呢？

学生。我自己。

老师。为什么呢？

学生。因为我知道我自己的局限性。

老师。那么你认为什么是一个人通往全能和统一的进化道路的动员因素？

学生。你是说如果我能用一个概念来概括它--尽管你之前告诉我这是做不到的？

老师。你学得很好。

学生。那就是相信自己。

老师。你自己的哪一部分？

学生。灵魂。

老师。而不是载体？

学生。好的，我需要信任我的全部。

老师。相信部分和整体。相信这些与第一源头的联系。相信上帝的碎片，它将所有这些复杂的东西协调成连贯的经验和知识，保证了对你神性的回忆。相信第一源泉所定义的进化过程。信任其中的每一个，超越那些与你相遇的外部声音，无论它们看起来多么无懈可击。相信你的自知之明，相信它有能力在你的旅程中引导你上升的螺旋。

学生。即使我只是个学生？

老师。我们不都是学生吗？

学生。但是有的人比我知道得更多。我觉得我知道的不多，无法相信自己。我怎样才能克服这种自我怀疑？

老师：这不是需要克服的问题。如果是这样，你还需要信任吗？

学生。我想不会。

老师。当你努力研究一个概念的细微差别时，你总是会遇到一堵墙，它界定了你记忆或经验的界限。当你发现这堵墙时，向别人寻求帮助是没有错的，但要记住，你是最了解自己需求的实体。你发现的那堵墙可能正是你当时所需要的。

学生。那么看来我需要更多了解我的自我利益和需求。

老师。你所拥有的需求，助长了你作为一个主权整体的进化。如果你饿了，你的胃会提醒你。如果你累了，你会打哈欠，你的眼皮会变得难以忍受的沉重。对于你作为一个主权整体的进化来说，相当于什么呢？

学生。这是个有趣的问题。我不知道。

老师。是什么导致你去寻找更高的自我？

学生。我猜是没有答案的问题。不知道我是谁，我要去哪里，或者我为什么在这里。

老师。真的吗？没有答案的问题会唤醒你的最高自我利益？

学生。从你的问题可以看出，我回答错了。那是什么呢？

老师：是灵感!来自你之前的精神导师的灵感。来自大自然的灵感。来自艺术的灵感。但最重要的是，它是来自你体内整体性导航者领域的灵感，进入你的人类工具，然后不知疲倦地点燃你的欲望，让你回忆起储存在你体内的神的碎片的现实。

学生。我怎样才能认识到这种灵感？

老师：认识它并不重要。重要的是你要感觉到它并欢迎它的存在，因为这是你发展自我信任和自我了解的方式。

学生。有什么技巧可以做到这一点吗？

老师。当然了。

学生。它们是什么？

老师。你还没有发明它们？

学生。我想你可能知道一些，你可以分享。

老师：我知道我自己的。我不知道你的。

学生。他们对每个人都不同？

老师：我不知道。

学生。你是如何创造你自己的技术的？

老师：如果你想与你想了解的人建立关系，你会做哪些事情？

学生。我可能会邀请他们喝茶聊天，或者可能给他们写一封介绍信，说明我希望与他们见面。

老师。如果他们没有反应。

学生。我可能会认为他们太忙了，或者更有可能的是没有兴趣与我见面。

老师。那么这就是问题所在。

学生。什么？

老师。人类的工具太容易放弃了，如果它邀请整体性导航仪进入其领域的话。

学生。我想我们都对拒绝很敏感。

老师。你认为有可能被第一源头的神圣工具所拒绝吗？

学生。我以前从未想过这个问题。也许？

老师：不是的。第一源泉的神圣工具对真诚的祈祷永远保持警惕，并且从不拒绝将他们的存在延伸到渴望提升意识的实体的人类工具中的提议。这是宇宙中不可改变的法则。

学生。除了简单地在祷告中请求外，是否有更好的方式来发出这种邀请？

教师：人们将听到的不是你的话语。而是你的感情和其动机的纯洁。你可以喝得酩酊大醉，用最响亮的声音说脏话，但如果你内心深处的感情是纯洁的、真诚的、谦卑的、以爱为动力的，你的邀请就会得到回应。相比之下，你可以冥想数日，努力成为完美的品格，并以最安静的低语问道，但如果你被荣誉和骄傲的动机所玷污，你的邀请很可能会被拒绝。

学生。为什么 "整体性导航员 "或第一源泉的任何神圣工具会关心这个问题？

老师。你为什么要关心你吃的食物是放在干净的盘子里还是脏的地板上？

学生。我不明白这种比较。

老师。人类的工具是一个容器，或灵魂载体。在你的星球上，它容纳了第一源的纯洁和完美的工具：整体性导航仪。如果人类的工具是不纯的，有物质的想法、自我膨胀的动机或仇恨的行为，就会使灵魂载体不容易接受整体性导航仪的振动。在某些情况下，如果整体性导航仪进入这样的容器并提供其能力，这些能力就会因自私的目的而被腐蚀。

学生。所以 "完整导航者 "不希望自己的能力被不纯净的灵魂载体所污染？

老师。这部分是正确的，但更多的是你体内的上帝碎片选择将它的能量暴露给一个邀请它分享其视野和理解的人类工具。一旦它被邀请，它将监测人类工具对其存在的反应。如果邀请被反复扩展，"上帝之粒 "将继续以注入的、精神主导的意识形式出现，指导人类工具完成其世俗使命。

学生。这听起来像是上帝碎片接管了。是这样的吗？

教师。上帝碎片为人类工具注入了神圣的视角。它使灵魂载体能够成为灵魂的视野，为第一源泉服务。这样一来，人类的工具就被改变了。

学生。我明白。我想我需要一些时间来理清这一切。谢谢你分享你的观点并帮助我理解。

老师。非常欢迎你。
