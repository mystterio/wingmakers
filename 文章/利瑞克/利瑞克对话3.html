Lyricus Discourse 3
The Nature of Knowledge
 

Student: Is there a technique to gain knowledge of God?

Teacher: What God do you speak of?

Student: The one and only source of all.

Teacher: No.

Student: Why then are there some who seem blessed with the knowledge of God, and some that seem completely ignorant of his presence and value? Surely those who are enlightened discovered a technique to secure their knowledge.

Teacher: There are no techniques. This is the great fallacy that has swept across the universe of sentient beings. We persist in our belief that there is a formula or ritual or teacher that can bring us enlightenment—or the knowledge of God.

Student: If there is no technique or teacher, then why does all of this exist? Why do you, my teacher, sit before me? Or why are there books and learned masters here, in this instructional setting? Are you telling me they’re all worthless?

Teacher: When there are questions there are answers waiting to be heard. All this exists for the questions of people such as you. If these questions did not exist, this would not exist.

Student: But what’s the point if the answers are not bringing me closer to the knowledge of God?

Teacher: Why doesn’t the knowledge of destruction lay in the hands of the many instead of the hands of the few?

Student: What do you mean?

Teacher: Why is the knowledge of how to destroy humankind—on a mass level—so carefully safeguarded?

Student: You’re talking about weapons of mass destruction?

Teacher: Yes.

Student: Naturally the technology is so destructive it needs to be managed and controlled by responsible governments.

Teacher: Why is it controlled?

Student: If it were in the power of any one person to destroy the lives of many, he or she might do so if they became sick of mind.

Teacher: Is the knowledge of mass destruction the opposite of the knowledge of mass enlightenment?

Student: I don’t know.

Teacher: What if you were given the power to enlighten the masses of humanity or destroy humanity? Would you not be the most powerful person on earth?

Student: I can’t imagine how I could be more powerful.

Teacher: How would you choose to wield your power?

Student: I suppose I’d have to have many advisors helping me to make the right decisions in order to build a great society that was rich in culture and learned citizens.

Teacher: What if the citizens that you ruled rebelled? What if they chose to be independent of your power? What would you do then?

Student: But if I had the power to enlighten them, why would they rebel? They would be enlightened and, as a result, they would choose to live harmoniously.

Teacher: But some might not want to be enlightened. Perhaps they feel that they know what is best for their development and would resist an outside source, no matter how benevolent and wise.

Student: Then I would let them have their own way.

Teacher: Even if they killed themselves and behaved in decadence?

Student: I would try to teach them how to behave properly so they would learn to live harmoniously.

Teacher: Do you think they would listen?

Student: If they didn’t, I’d place the good and respectful people separate from those that were warring and cruel.

Teacher: I see. So you would divide your citizens into two groups?

Student: It would be the only way to bring harmony to some, if it couldn’t be brought to all.

Teacher: And if the warring and cruel citizens ultimately had children that desired to live in harmony, what would happen then?

Student: They would only need to ask and they could rejoin the society.

Teacher: So the citizens of your society would accept them without any problem and confer upon them the same social benefits that they themselves enjoy?

Student: Yes.

Teacher: And if they didn’t?

Student: I would have to order it—make it a law—I suppose. But again, if I had the power to enlighten my citizens, they surely would forgive those that were led astray by their parents, and let them re-enter the broader society.

Teacher: And what would be the result if one of these new citizens murdered someone within your enlightened society?

Student: They would be expelled and punished.

Teacher: Not enlightened?

Student: I would assume they were not able to be enlightened.

Teacher: So your power to enlighten was not perfect.

Student: I guess not.

Teacher: And what if the decadent society decided that the enlightened society should be conquered?

Student: Why would they attack if they knew I had the power to annihilate them?

Teacher: Perhaps they believed you didn’t actually possess the power, or if you did, that you would never use it.

Student: We would then have to defend ourselves and capture the decadent society’s leaders and lock them up until they changed their ways of thinking and acting.

Teacher: Then your power to destroy was not perfect either.

Student: Not in the same way I thought it was.

Teacher: You have answered these hypothetical questions wisely. Do you see how power complicates?

Student: Yes.

Teacher: Do you understand that having the power to enlighten or destroy is a type of power that most people consign to God?

Student: Yes.

Teacher: So I was asking you to play God, hypothetically.

Student: I understand, but how does that answer my question about gaining the knowledge of God?

Teacher: It may not. I simply wanted you to have a glimpse of the perspective of the human-imagined God.

Student: Why?

Teacher: If you want the knowledge of God, you must have some perspective on the position of a God.

Student: But I didn’t mean that I wanted to have the knowledge of the God that humans have created.

Teacher: It’s the only knowledge you can have.

Student: Why can’t I obtain the knowledge of the true God, First Source? Why isn’t there a technique that I can use to find and acquire this knowledge?

Teacher: Let’s return to our hypothetical scenario. Suppose that your power to destroy was simply a thought away. If you became angry, your power to destroy would be unleashed and the recipient of your anger would be obliterated.

Student: Would it work the same way for enlightenment? In other words, would I be able to enlighten with a simple thought?

Teacher: Yes.

Student: Okay.

Teacher: How many times a day do you have an angry thought and a thought to enlighten someone?

Student: I don’t know. On a good day, I don’t have any angry thoughts.

Teacher: On a bad day?

Student: Maybe three or four.

Teacher: Each time you have these thoughts, if you were angry with a person, your anger would harm the object of your rage.

Student: What about the other side of the coin. What if I were loving and kind, would my thoughts enlighten them as well?

Teacher: Precisely.

Student: So, with nothing but my thoughts, I can harm or help a person.

Teacher: Yes.

Student: Then wouldn’t it make sense that if I had the knowledge of God, I would also have the discipline to control my thoughts and emotions?

Teacher: No.

Student: Why?

Teacher: Because your dominant reality is that of a human being with all its weaknesses and foibles. You are designed to have spontaneous thoughts and emotions. You have instincts that respond to stimuli, and you cannot control your natural thoughts or emotions. You can suppress them. You can ignore them. You can even extinguish them, but only for a period of time.

Student: And this is why I can’t have the knowledge of God?

Teacher: Correct.

Student: Then every human is sealed inside a world of limitation because they have this inability to control their impulses—be they thoughts or emotions? It seems unfair.

Teacher: Perhaps, but this same limitation is liberating.

Student: In what way?

Teacher: Do you know the will of First Source?

Student: No, but I think I have an idea of what is aligned with the will of God and what is not.

Teacher: If you truly know what is aligned and what it not, then you would need to know the will of First Source, would you not?

Student: I mean that I know the general direction, or intention of God’s will.

Teacher: But not the details?

Student: Correct. I know that what is of love and light is aligned with the will of God, and what is of evil and darkness is not. But I might not be able to distinguish between the more subtle shades of light and darkness or good and evil.

Teacher: I see. And how did you arrive at this conclusion?

Student: It is what I have been taught.

Teacher: And who taught you this?

Student: My teachers, the books I’ve read. Everyone believes this don’t they?

Teacher: And because you have been taught that the will of God is knowable, you believe you can make the judgment that a loving act is aligned, but an evil act is not.

Student: Basically, yes.

Teacher: What if I suggested to you that understanding the will of God is one and the same as possessing the knowledge of God?

Student: I’m not sure I understand what you mean.

Teacher: What do you think I mean? Make an effort to express your thoughts, no matter how murky they may be. Sometimes the fog lifts only when you struggle to see through it.

Student: I have the sense that you’re suggesting that if I understand what the creator desires from his creation, I would also understand a key component of the knowledge of God. In other words, in order to have the knowledge of God, I must know what God wants from me, what he desired me to become.

Teacher: And what do you think God wants you to become?

Student: Liberated.

Teacher: From limitation?

Student: Yes. Exactly.

Teacher: First Source desires that you live without limitation, but creates a soul carrier and a setting for that soul carrier to live within that is rooted in limitation. Why do think it is the will of God that you shrug off your limitations?

Student: Because if I have no limitations, I am liberated of the things that reduce my spiritual awareness.

Teacher: And what will you do then—when you are free of all limitation?

Student: I’m not exactly sure, but it will be blissful and likened to what Buddha called Nirvana—freedom from desire.

Teacher: Why would your Creator create you, set you in a soul carrier that was bound to a reality of limitation, construct an elaborate universe school to educate you, and commission a vast array of instructors, only to enable you to pass into Nirvana, or a blissful state?

Student: I don’t know. That’s in part what I’m trying to understand.

Teacher: Are you sure?

Student: Well it’s certainly one of the things I’m trying to understand.

Teacher: If you’re trying to understand this, then answer my question.

Student: But I don’t know the answer.

Teacher: Try to articulate it as best you can.

Student: I agree it doesn’t make sense that God would have me educated in the ways of the universe and then leave me to simply enjoy it, but I don’t know what else I would do. No one paints this picture very clearly.

Teacher: The picture, as you put it, is found in the service to a plan. The plan is the collective unfolding of souls to realize the singular nature of universehood as an undivided process. We move from neighborhoods to cities, to states, to nations, to continents, to hemispheres, to planets, to solar systems, to galaxies, to local universes, to Superuniverses, to the Grand Multiverse—the all-encompassing structure of our collective unity. And at every step we emerge the victor of the lesser state of being in that our lives increasingly exemplify the presence of our collective perception of what is best for the evolutionary course set forth by First Source for the Grand Multiverse.

Student: Okay, so this is the reason? To simply be able to hold the perspective of what is best for the Grand Multiverse? How can I ever know such a thing?

Teacher: You cannot.

Student: So again, I’m frustrated in ignorance. This seems to be the theme of spiritual matters.

Teacher: It is only because you take the undivided process and leap to its end, wishing to bring it closer into your reality of now. Your patience is exceeded by your vision of what is to be.

Student: I know. But what can I do about it?

Teacher: Define the knowledge that you need to accomplish each step of your process. Don’t profess to need the knowledge of God before you have the knowledge of your earth world or the knowledge of your human instrument. Frame your knowledge in the context of your design.

Student: How do you mean that?

Teacher: You are a physical body with complex, emotional impulses and instincts; you are also a system of nerves and data collectors that feed your consciousness and brain. Moreover, you are a collective of consciousnesses that span your entire species and time. These elements comprise your human instrument. Like most seekers, you try to understand the mysterious substance of your inmost spirit—the Wholeness Navigator—before you understand your human instrument. And even more to the point, you seek to understand the Creator and sustainer of the Wholeness Navigator before you understand your inmost spirit. You have intuited the undivided process because it is stored within you, but if you stretch the reach of your understanding it is because you seek to know the stars before you know the planet upon which you stand. And I ask you, what good is the knowledge of the stars when your home is misunderstood?

Student: You’re saying that I need to study my body and mind before I study the soul?

Teacher: No, I’m saying the knowledge of God that you seek is contained in every step of the undivided process. It is not realized in some sudden, elusive revelatory experience at the end of your journey. It is found in every step along the way.

Student: Yes, I understand this in concept. I’ve heard this many times before, but I sense that you’re making a different distinction here.

Teacher: Perhaps. I’m only recommending that you understand the soul carrier before you seek to know the soul, and that you understand the soul before you seek to understand its Creator. Otherwise, if you first channel your energy into understanding the Creator, you will see it marginally, and this partial knowledge will deform your understanding of the soul carrier and the soul within it.

Student: But how will I know that my understanding of the soul carrier is adequate so that I can embark on the understanding of my soul?

Teacher: The human instrument is an amazing composite of miraculous connections between the material and non-physical worlds. When you understand these connections, they will guide you to your understanding of the soul within you.

Student: So then I should really be asking you about how I can gain the knowledge of these connections. Is that correct?

Teacher: Yes.

Student: So how do I? Is it the chakras that are key?

Teacher: Much has been said and written about the energy centers that are revealed within the human instrument, but these energy centers are not the connections between the physical and non-physical realms. What weaves together the physical body with the non-physical bodies is what we refer to as the phantom core.

Student: What is this composed of?

Teacher: The phantom core is not composed of anything material. It is like a shadow of soul consciousness that can move between the realms of the human instrument.

Student: So it can operate equally well within the mind and body?

Teacher: The phantom core is the consciousness that moves between the body, emotions, mind, and genetic mind at speeds greater than light. Yet it is a point of awareness that distributes the experiences of the human instrument to the soul.

Student: Does it embellish the experiences or simply report them like a recorder?

Teacher: It reports everything in extraordinary terms.

Student: How do you mean?

Teacher: Even in the quiet moments of your life when you are staring through a window or reading a book, there is a great universe of experience that is perceived by this phantom core, and every miniature detail is faithfully recorded and transmitted to the soul. The phantom core is the super consciousness of the human instrument. It is separate from the soul, and is considered the soul’s emissary to the natural world in which the human instrument must interact. It is through this awareness that soul experiences the natural world of limitation and separation, drawing in the experiences that help it build appreciation for the Grand Multiverse that is the garment of First Source.

Student: Why have I never heard of this before?

Teacher: Who should tell you?

Student: You, for one.

Teacher: I just did, were you not listening?

Student: Yes, but I’ve been your
student for two years and this is the first I’ve heard of this phantom core. Why?

Teacher: We teach through association and metaphor. You have been taught about the phantom core, you just haven’t heard its name before now. And now that you have its name, it crystallizes in your mind a clearer picture of its design and purpose.

Student: But two years it takes for me to know its name?

Teacher: For some it is two hours, for some it a lifetime. It depends on the person and how they arrive at their answers. You sought the unknowable before you sought what is to be known in your present life—where your consciousness resides now.

Student: Okay, we’ve established that I’m a dreamer—

Teacher: There’s nothing wrong with seeking the unknowable. I am not suggesting that you have wasted your time in the pursuit of a dream.

Student: But it seems that I need to place more time in understanding this phantom core. What do you recommend I learn in this regard?

Teacher: Learn all that you can about the human body, emotions, and mind. Make it the focus of your study for a period of time—perhaps a year or two, depending on the availability of your time. As you do this, take notes about the features of the human instrument that either seem connected or anomalous. For example, the brain is dominated by the data received from the eyes. Why do the eyes not dominate consciousness? As you produce your notes, organized around connections and anomalous phenomenon, begin to define the structure of the human instrument as one would if they were making a map of the interaction between the body, emotions, mind, and genetic mind. Remember that the phantom core is the shadow of the soul and operates seamlessly between the folds of the human instrument. It is the first perceiver and transmitter of the experience that consumes the human instrument of a specific individuality. It is the continuity of the undivided process within the material realms, while the soul is the continuity of the undivided process within the non-physical realms.

Student: And what about the Wholeness Navigator?

Teacher: It is the bridge of continuity between these two worlds. The Wholeness Navigator is the interlock between the worlds of time and the worlds of non-time. It is the fusion of the soul and the phantom core, integrating this vast experiential storehouse of data, and making it coherent as a force of transformation.

Student: It will take me a long time to create this picture and understand the connections.

Teacher: It will take you a lifetime, if you are fortunate. However, if you set forth upon the path of First Source without first understanding the fundamental structures within which your soul operates, you will pursue a mirage. God will appear and disappear, and doubt will shake you every time a new occurrence crosses your path. It will seem that all is impermanent, even the face of God.

Student: You said a moment ago that the Wholeness Navigator uses the experiences of the soul carrier and soul as a force of transformation. Transformation of whom and for what purpose?

Teacher: The transformation is of the individual personality—the God-fragment that sojourns in both the worlds of time and non-time, and is devoted to the One Plan that embraces all forms, personalities, and opinions therein. This personality is the identity that endures the shape shifting of forms and the ceaseless churning of time to become a conscious extension of the One Plan. The purpose of this transformation is to explore the Grand Multiverse as emissaries of First Source, creating new opportunities for the expansion and ongoing evolution of the One Plan.

Student: I suspect you purposely gave me an abstract answer as a way of reminding me of the task ahead.

Teacher: I gave you what is available to be given. Words themselves are an abstraction, are they not?

Student: If you don’t mind, I want to return to my task: studying the human instrument. Is there a model I can use so I can compare my approach with others?

Teacher: There may be some who would gladly share their research and findings. I would encourage you to collaborate with your fellow
students. It is a very useful practice.

Student: You spoke of connections in the human instrument and anomalous phenomenon. Can you please elaborate on these?

Teacher: The connections of the human instrument are the threads that make up the fabric of the phantom core. These threads weave the pathways between the physical body, emotions, mind, and genetic mind. Within each of these are sub-layers, just as the skin of the human body is different than the nervous system, which is different than the skeletal structure. The body is therefore made up of many layers and sub-components that comprise the total structure. This is equally true for the emotions, mind, and genetic mind. The connections between these layers or strata of the human instrument, which number twenty-four primary systems, each originate from the Wholeness Navigator. In other words, these threads have a common ground and spiral out touching each of the twenty-four primary systems, binding them together in a holistic system.

Student: What are the twenty-four systems? Do I know them?

Teacher: It is not important to recognize each of them individually. Some have not been discovered in the world of time and space. I only mention the number so that you can know the depth of the human instrument and its impeccable and miraculous structure.

Student: Why is this so important?

Teacher: The human instrument is regarded by most cultures as a body that is vulnerable and fragile. It is considered flawed and imperfect because it degenerates over time and is susceptible to disease. In some areas, it is considered nothing more than an animate object for the sensing of pleasure or pain. It is held in low regard, and even those who feel a spiritual imperative, regard it as the lesser or lower self.

Student: But it is the lower self isn’t it?

Teacher: It is the vessel of the transcendent soul. When you see a vessel of beauty, do you wonder what is inside it?

Student: I guess when I see a beautiful vessel—like a work of art—I assume the vessel is for appreciation, not utility.

Teacher: It doesn’t require a utilitarian function because its beauty is sufficient a purpose. Correct?

Student: Exactly.

Teacher: The human instrument is the same way. It is a beautifully conceived creation; so much so that most believe it is empty. Its purpose is in itself. They do not see the twenty-four strata, they perceive only the five dominant strata: skin, muscle, bones, emotions, and mind.

Student: Why? Why do we only see these five and not the whole twenty-four?

Teacher: You are taught these perceptions by your educational indoctrination and society as a whole, and conversely, you are not taught to appreciate and understand the other nineteen strata. In most cases, these strata require more vigilance and persistence to understand and appreciate.

Student: So how do I learn about the other dimensions of the human instrument?

Teacher: You study the human instrument. You study the body, emotions, mind, and genetic mind. You learn to understand this sacred vessel for what it truly is: the exploratory, albeit temporary, vehicle of your inmost, immortal consciousness in the worlds of time and space.

Student: But if you gave me information about the twenty-four strata, wouldn’t it help me in my studies?

Teacher: Perhaps, but it is not necessary to understand all these levels with the human mind. And here again, you seek to know the staircase before you understand the first few steps. It is the function of time to make the staircase comprehensible in steps, not singular revelations.

Student: I understand.

Teacher: I have highlighted the universal path; now tell me what you have learned.

Student: Okay, I’ll do my best. The phantom core connects the twenty-four levels of the human instrument, and is the observing consciousness of the worlds of time and space for the human soul. The phantom core has multiple threads, for lack of a better description, that weave these twenty-four levels together, and it uses these connective threads like pathways to move—as a consciousness—from one level to the next at quantum speeds. It then passes this experiential information to the soul, which then processes this incoming data in order to evolve its understanding of how to align with the One Plan and increasingly bring light to the darker outposts of the Grand Multiverse.

Teacher: Take a deep breath. You have listened well.

Student: Did I get it right?

Teacher: Are you concerned about being right or are you interested in learning?

Student: Are they so different?

Teacher: They can be polar opposites.

Student: I’m interested in learning and being right.

Teacher: You asked me at the beginning of this dialogue, as to whether there is a technique to gain the knowledge of God. Do you remember?

Student: Yes.

Teacher: And have you discovered your answer?

Student: No. I don’t think there is an answer.

Teacher: Perhaps there’s an answer, but it is different for every human. All beings approach their Creator in a unique path that has never been navigated before. If you stitched together the vast reservoir of your experience in the worlds of time and space, do you think it has ever been replicated?

Student: I don’t know. I’ve never thought about it before. Perhaps at a basic level it has.

Teacher: Only if you grossly simplified it would you see any similarity in the paths of the ascending souls to their Creator’s realm. Truthfully, we are each as unique as the planets that number the Grand Universe, and it is precisely this uniqueness that prevents a universal technique from ever becoming the magical pill of enlightenment.

Student: I understand this. Was this done as part of the design?

Teacher: Yes.

Student: I guess the real question is what knowledge is required in order to construct my own techniques for gaining the awareness of my own, multi-layered self?

Teacher: You are on your way if it is your practice to make this inquiry every morning that you arise, and you feel yourself a magnet attracting this very knowledge into your life through every facet of your experience.

Student: Does it help if I believe that the phantom core is present within me and absorbing this knowledge even if my conscious mind is not?

Teacher: It does and it is.

Student: I am grateful.

Teacher: You are most welcome.

Lyricus论述3
知识的本质
 

学生。有什么技巧可以获得对上帝的认识吗？

老师。你说的是什么神？

学生。唯一的源头，所有的源头。

老师。没有。

学生。那为什么有些人似乎被上帝的知识所祝福，而有些人似乎完全不知道他的存在和价值？当然，那些开明的人发现了一种技术来确保他们的知识。

老师。没有什么技巧。这是席卷整个宇宙众生的伟大谬论。我们坚持认为有一种公式、仪式或老师可以给我们带来启迪，或者是对上帝的认识。

学生。如果没有技术或老师，那么为什么会有这一切的存在？为什么你，我的老师，坐在我面前？或者说，为什么在这个教学环境中，会有书籍和学识渊博的大师们在这里？你是在告诉我他们都是毫无价值的吗？

老师。当有问题的时候，就有答案等待着我们去聆听。所有这些都是为了像你这样的人的问题而存在。如果这些问题不存在，这就不会存在。

学生。但如果答案不能使我更接近对神的认识，那还有什么意义呢？

老师。为什么毁灭的知识不在许多人的手中，而在少数人的手中？

学生。你是什么意思？

老师。为什么关于如何毁灭人类的知识--在大规模的层面上--得到如此仔细的保护？

学生。你说的是大规模杀伤性武器？

老师。是的。

学生。自然，该技术的破坏性很大，需要由负责任的政府来管理和控制。

老师。为什么它被控制？

学生。如果任何一个人有能力摧毁许多人的生命，他或她可能会这样做，如果他或她变得心智不健全。

老师：大规模破坏的知识与大规模启蒙的知识是相反的吗？

学生。我不知道。

老师。如果你被赋予启迪人类大众或毁灭人类的权力呢？你会不会成为地球上最强大的人？

学生。我无法想象我怎么能更有力量。

教师：你会选择如何行使你的权力？

学生。我想我必须要有很多顾问帮助我做出正确的决定，才能建立一个文化丰富、公民学识渊博的伟大社会。

老师。如果你所统治的公民反叛了呢？如果他们选择独立于你的权力呢？那时你会怎么做？

学生。但是如果我有能力开导他们，他们为什么要反叛？他们会得到启迪，因此，他们会选择和谐地生活。

老师。但是有些人可能不想被启蒙。也许他们觉得自己知道什么对自己的发展是最好的，并会抵制外部的来源，不管是多么仁慈和明智的。

学生。那么我将让他们有自己的方式。

老师。即使他们自杀了，行为颓废了？

学生。我会努力教他们如何正确地做人，这样他们就会学会和谐地生活。

老师。你认为他们会听吗？

学生。如果他们不这样做，我就会把善良和尊重的人与那些好战和残忍的人分开。

老师：我明白了。所以你会把你的公民分成两组？

学生。如果不能给所有人带来和谐，这将是给一些人带来和谐的唯一方法。

老师。如果交战的残酷的公民最终有了渴望和谐生活的孩子，那时会发生什么？

学生。他们只需要问一下，就可以重新加入社会了。

老师。所以你们社会的公民会毫无问题地接受他们，并赋予他们与他们自己一样的社会福利？

学生。是的。

老师。如果他们不这样做呢？

学生。我想我必须命令它--使之成为法律。但是，如果我有能力启迪我的公民，他们肯定会原谅那些被父母引入歧途的人，让他们重新进入更广泛的社会。

老师。如果这些新公民中有人在你们的开明社会中谋杀了某人，会有什么结果？

学生。他们会被开除并受到惩罚。

老师。没有开悟？

学生。我想他们是无法开悟的。

老师。所以你的启蒙能力并不完美。

学生。我想不是。

老师。如果颓废的社会决定要征服开明的社会呢？

学生。如果他们知道我有能力消灭他们，他们为什么要攻击？

老师。也许他们认为你实际上并不拥有这种能力，或者即使你拥有这种能力，你也不会使用它。

学生。然后，我们将不得不保卫自己，抓住腐朽社会的领导人，把他们关起来，直到他们改变思维和行为方式。

老师。那么你毁灭的能力也不完美。

学生。与我想的不一样。

老师。你已经明智地回答了这些假设性问题。你看到权力是如何复杂化的吗？

学生。是的。

老师。你是否明白，拥有启迪或毁灭的力量是一种大多数人寄托在上帝身上的力量？

学生。是的。

老师。所以我是要你扮演上帝，假想一下。

学生。我明白，但这如何回答我关于获得神的知识的问题？

老师：不一定。我只是想让你对人类想象中的上帝的视角有一丝了解。

学生。为什么？

老师：如果你想了解上帝，你必须对上帝的地位有一些看法。

学生。但我的意思并不是说我想拥有人类所创造的上帝的知识。

老师：这是你唯一能拥有的知识。

学生。为什么我不能获得关于真神、第一源的知识？为什么没有一种技术可以让我找到并获得这种知识？

老师。让我们回到我们的假设情景中去。假设你的毁灭能力只是一念之差。如果你生气了，你的破坏力就会释放出来，你愤怒的对象就会被抹杀。

学生。它对开悟的作用也是一样的吗？换句话说，我是否能够用一个简单的想法来开悟？

老师。是的。

学生。好的。

老师：你每天有多少次愤怒的想法和开导别人的想法？

学生。我不知道。在一个好的日子里，我没有任何愤怒的想法。

老师。在一个糟糕的日子里？

学生。也许是三或四个。

老师。每次你有这些想法时，如果你对一个人生气，你的愤怒会伤害到你愤怒的对象。

学生。那硬币的另一面呢。如果我有爱心和善心，我的想法是否也能启迪他们呢？

老师。正是如此。

学生。所以，除了我的想法，我可以伤害或帮助一个人。

老师。是的。

学生。那么，如果我有关于上帝的知识，我也会有控制自己思想和情绪的纪律，这不是很合理吗？

老师。没有。

学生。为什么？

老师。因为你的主导现实是一个具有所有弱点和缺点的人。你被设计成具有自发的思想和情感。你有对刺激作出反应的本能，你无法控制你的自然思想或情绪。你可以压制它们。你可以不理会它们。你甚至可以熄灭它们，但只是在一段时间内。

学生。这就是为什么我不能拥有上帝的知识？

老师。正确。

学生。那么每个人都被封在一个限制的世界里，因为他们无法控制自己的冲动--无论是思想还是情绪？这似乎不公平。

老师。也许，但这种限制也是一种解放。

学生。在什么方面？

老师。你知道第一源的意愿吗？

学生。没有，但我想我有一个想法，什么是符合神的旨意，什么是不符合。

老师：如果你真的知道什么是一致的，什么是不一致的，那么你就需要知道第一源的意愿，不是吗？

学生。我的意思是，我知道上帝意志的大方向，或意图。

老师。但不是细节？

学生。正确。我知道属于爱和光的东西与神的意志一致，而属于恶和黑暗的东西则不一致。但我可能无法区分光明与黑暗或善与恶的更微妙的色调。

老师：我明白了。那你是如何得出这个结论的呢？

学生。这是我所受的教育。

老师。谁教你的？

学生。我的老师，我读过的书。每个人都相信这些，不是吗？

老师。因为你被教导说上帝的旨意是可知的，所以你相信你可以做出判断，一个爱的行为是一致的，但一个邪恶的行为不是。

学生。基本上，是的。

老师。如果我向你建议，理解上帝的旨意与拥有上帝的知识是一样的呢？

学生。我不确定我是否理解你的意思。

老师。你认为我是什么意思？努力表达你的想法，不管它们有多模糊。有时，只有当你努力看穿它时，雾才会散开。

学生。我觉得你的意思是，如果我理解造物主对他的创造物的渴望，我也会理解对上帝的认识的一个关键部分。换句话说，为了拥有对神的认识，我必须知道神想从我身上得到什么，他希望我成为什么。

老师。那么你认为上帝希望你成为什么？

学生。解放了。

老师。从限制？

学生。是的。正是如此。

老师。第一源头希望你能无限制地生活，但却创造了一个灵魂载体，并为这个灵魂载体创造了一个植根于限制的生活环境。为什么认为这是上帝的旨意，让你甩掉你的限制？

学生。因为如果我没有限制，我就能从那些降低我精神意识的东西中解放出来。

老师。那时候你会怎么做--当你摆脱了所有的限制？

学生。我不太确定，但它将是幸福的，类似于佛陀所说的涅槃--从欲望中解脱。

老师。为什么你的造物主要创造你，把你放在一个被限制的现实所束缚的灵魂载体中，建造一个精心设计的宇宙学校来教育你，并委托大量的导师，只是为了让你进入涅槃，或一个幸福的状态？

学生。我不知道。这就是我试图理解的部分内容。

老师。你确定吗？

学生。嗯，这当然是我试图理解的事情之一。

老师：如果你想了解这个，那就回答我的问题。

学生。但我不知道答案。

老师。尽量把它表达清楚。

学生。我同意，上帝让我接受宇宙之道的教育，然后让我简单地享受它，这说不通，但我不知道我还会做什么。没有人把这幅画描绘得很清楚。

老师。正如你所说的，这幅画是在为一个计划服务中发现的。这个计划是灵魂的集体展开，以实现宇宙性的奇异性质，作为一个不分割的过程。我们从邻里到城市，到州，到国家，到大陆，到半球，到行星，到太阳系，到星系，到局部宇宙，到超级宇宙，到大多元宇宙--我们集体统一性的全方位结构。在每一步，我们都会成为较小的存在状态的胜利者，因为我们的生活越来越体现出我们对第一源为大多元宇宙设定的进化路线的最佳看法的存在。

学生。好的，所以这就是原因？仅仅是为了能够持有对大宇宙最有利的观点？我怎么能知道这样的事情呢？

老师。你不能。

学生。因此，我又一次在无知中感到沮丧。这似乎是精神事务的主题。

老师：这只是因为你把这个不完整的过程和跳跃到它的终点，希望把它带入你现在的现实。你的耐心被你对将要发生的事情的设想所超越。

学生。我知道。但我能做什么呢？

教师。界定你在完成过程中每一步所需要的知识。在你拥有地球世界的知识或人类工具的知识之前，不要自称需要上帝的知识。在你的设计范围内确定你的知识。

学生。你这话是什么意思？

老师。你是一个具有复杂的、情感冲动和本能的肉体；你也是一个神经系统和数据收集器，为你的意识和大脑提供能量。此外，你是一个跨越你整个物种和时间的意识集体。这些元素构成了你的人类工具。像大多数寻求者一样，在理解你的人类工具之前，你试图理解你最内在的精神的神秘物质--整体性导航仪。更重要的是，你在理解你的内在精神之前，试图理解 "整体性导航仪 "的创造者和维持者。你已经直觉到了完整的过程，因为它储存在你体内，但如果你延伸了你的理解范围，那是因为你在了解你所站的星球之前，就想了解星星。我问你，当你的家被误解时，对星星的了解有什么用？

学生。你是说我需要在研究灵魂之前先研究我的身体和思想？

老师。不，我是说你所寻求的关于上帝的知识包含在不分割过程的每一步中。它不是在你的旅程结束时某个突然的、难以捉摸的启示性经验中实现的。它是在沿途的每一步中被发现的。

学生。是的，我在概念上理解这个。我以前听过很多次，但我感觉你在这里做了一个不同的区分。

老师。也许吧。我只是建议你在寻求了解灵魂之前先了解灵魂载体，在寻求了解其创造者之前先了解灵魂。否则，如果你先把精力用在理解造物主上，你就会看到它的不足，而这种片面的知识会使你对灵魂载体和其中的灵魂的理解变形。

学生。但是我怎么知道我对灵魂载体的理解是充分的，这样我就可以着手理解我的灵魂？

老师。人类的工具是物质世界和非物质世界之间神奇联系的惊人组合。当你理解这些联系时，它们将引导你理解你体内的灵魂。

学生。所以，我应该真正问你，我怎样才能获得这些联系的知识。这样做对吗？

老师。是的。

学生。那么我怎么做呢？脉轮才是关键吗？

老师。关于人类工具内所显示的能量中心，人们已经说了很多，也写了很多，但这些能量中心并不是物理和非物理领域的连接。将肉体与非肉体编织在一起的是我们所说的幻影核心。

学生。这是由什么组成的？

老师。幻影核心不是由任何物质组成的。它就像一个灵魂意识的影子，可以在人类工具的领域之间移动。

学生。所以它可以在头脑和身体中同样运作？

老师。幻影核心是在身体、情绪、思想和遗传思想之间以超过光的速度移动的意识。然而它是一个意识点，将人类工具的经验分配给灵魂。

学生。它是否美化了这些经历，或者只是像记录者一样报告它们？

教师：它以非常规的方式报告了一切。

学生。你是什么意思？

老师。即使在你的生活中，当你盯着窗户或看书的安静时刻，也有一个伟大的经验宇宙被这个幻影核心所感知，每一个微型的细节都被忠实地记录下来并传递给灵魂。幻影核心是人类工具的超级意识。它与灵魂分离，被认为是灵魂对人类工具必须互动的自然世界的使者。正是通过这种意识，灵魂体验到了限制和分离的自然世界，吸取了帮助它建立对作为第一源头衣服的大多元宇宙的欣赏。

学生。为什么我以前从未听说过这个？

老师。谁应该告诉你？

学生。你，就是其中之一。

老师：我刚才说了，你没听清楚吗？

学生。是的，但我一直是你的
学生两年了，这是我第一次听说这个幻影核心。为什么？

老师。我们通过联想和比喻进行教学。你已经被教导过关于幻影核心的知识，只是在这之前你还没有听到它的名字。现在你有了它的名字，它在你的脑海中形成了一幅更清晰的设计和目的。

学生。但我需要两年时间才能知道它的名字？

老师。对有些人来说是两个小时，对有些人来说是一辈子。这取决于个人以及他们是如何得出答案的。你在寻找不可知的东西之前，先寻找你现在的生活中可知的东西--你的意识现在所处的位置。

学生。好的，我们已经确定我是一个梦想家------。

老师。寻求不可知的东西并没有错。我并不是说你在追求梦想的过程中浪费了自己的时间。

学生。但是，我似乎需要把更多的时间放在理解这个幻影核心上。你建议我在这方面学习什么？

老师。学习所有关于人类身体、情感和思想的知识。把它作为你研究的重点，持续一段时间，也许是一年或两年，这取决于你的时间。当你这样做的时候，记下人类仪器的特征，这些特征要么看起来有联系，要么是反常的。例如，大脑被来自眼睛的数据所支配。为什么眼睛没有支配意识？当你产生你的笔记时，围绕连接和异常现象组织起来，开始定义人类仪器的结构，就像人们在绘制身体、情感、思想和遗传思想之间的互动地图一样。记住，幻影核心是灵魂的影子，在人类仪器的褶皱之间无缝运作。它是第一个感知者和经验的传递者，它消耗了人类工具的特定个体性。它是物质领域内未分割过程的延续，而灵魂是非物质领域内未分割过程的延续。

学生。那么 "整体性导航 "呢？

老师：它是这两个世界之间连续性的桥梁。整体性导航仪是时间世界和非时间世界之间的联锁。它是灵魂和幻影核心的融合，整合了这个庞大的经验数据仓库，并使其连贯成为一种转化的力量。

学生。我需要花很长时间来创造这幅画并理解其中的联系。

老师：如果你幸运的话，这将需要你一生的时间。然而，如果你不先了解你灵魂运作的基本结构，就踏上了第一源泉的道路，你将追求一个海市蜃楼。上帝会出现和消失，每当有新的事情发生在你的道路上，怀疑就会动摇你。似乎所有的东西都是无常的，甚至上帝的面孔也是如此。

学生。你刚才说，完整的导航员利用灵魂载体和灵魂的经验作为一种转变的力量。改造谁，为了什么目的？

老师。转变的是个人的人格--在时间和非时间的世界中游荡的神的碎片，并致力于一个计划，其中包括所有的形式、人格和观点。这个人格是一种身份，它经受住了形式的转变和时间的无休止的搅动，成为一个计划的有意识的延伸。这种转变的目的是作为第一源泉的使者探索大多元宇宙，为 "一个计划 "的扩展和持续演化创造新的机会。

学生。我怀疑你故意给我一个抽象的答案，以此来提醒我前面的任务。

老师：我给了你可以给的东西。词语本身就是一种抽象的东西，不是吗？

学生。如果你不介意的话，我想回到我的任务上：研究人类的工具。有没有一个我可以使用的模型，以便我可以将我的方法与其他人进行比较？

老师。可能有一些人很乐意分享他们的研究和发现。我鼓励你与你的同学合作
学生。这是一个非常有用的做法。

学生。你谈到了人类仪器和反常现象中的联系。能否请您详细介绍一下这些？

老师。人类仪器的连接是构成幻影核心结构的线。这些线编织了身体、情绪、思想和遗传思想之间的通路。在每一个里面都有分层，就像人体的皮肤与神经系统不同，而神经系统又与骨骼结构不同。因此，身体是由许多层和子组件组成的总结构。这对情绪、心智和遗传心智也同样适用。人类工具的这些层或地层之间的联系，有24个主要系统，每个都源于整体性导航仪。换句话说，这些线有一个共同的基础，并螺旋式地触及24个主要系统中的每一个，将它们结合在一个整体的系统中。

学生。二十四个系统是什么？我知道它们吗？

教师：逐一认识它们并不重要。有些还没有在时间和空间的世界里被发现。我只提到这个数字，以便你能知道人类工具的深度和它无懈可击的神奇结构。

学生。为什么这一点如此重要？

老师。大多数文化都认为人类的工具是一个脆弱的身体。它被认为是有缺陷和不完美的，因为它随着时间的推移而退化，容易受到疾病的影响。在某些地区，它被认为不过是一个感知快乐或痛苦的有生命的物体。它被看得很低，甚至那些感觉到精神需要的人，也把它看作是较小的或较低的自我。

学生。但它是低级自我，不是吗？

老师：它是超越的灵魂的容器。当你看到一个美丽的容器时，你是否想知道它里面是什么？

学生。我想，当我看到一个美丽的容器--如艺术品--我认为这个容器是用来欣赏的，而不是实用的。

老师：它不需要功利性的功能，因为它的美貌就足以成为一种目的。对吗？

学生。正是如此。

老师。人类的工具也是如此。它是一个构思精美的创作；以至于大多数人认为它是空的。它的目的就在它自己身上。他们没有看到二十四个阶层，他们只看到五个主要阶层：皮肤、肌肉、骨骼、情感和思想。

学生。为什么？为什么我们只看到这五个，而不是整个二十四个？

老师。你被你的教育灌输和整个社会灌输了这些观念，反之，你没有被教导去欣赏和理解其他十九个阶层。在大多数情况下，这些阶层需要更多的警惕和坚持来理解和欣赏。

学生。那么，我怎样才能了解人类工具的其他方面？

老师。你研究人类的工具。你研究身体、情感、思想和遗传思想。你学会理解这个神圣的容器的真正含义：探索性的，尽管是暂时的，你最内在的、不朽的意识在时间和空间世界的载体。

学生。但是如果你给我关于二十四层的信息，对我的学习没有帮助吗？

老师。也许吧，但没有必要用人的思维去理解所有这些层次。在这里，你在理解最初的几步之前就想知道这个阶梯。时间的作用是让人一步步理解这个楼梯，而不是单一的启示。

学生。我明白。

老师：我已经强调了宇宙之路，现在告诉我你学到了什么。

学生。好的，我会尽力的。幻影核心连接着人类工具的二十四个层次，是人类灵魂对时间和空间世界的观察意识。幻影核心有多条线，因为缺乏更好的描述，把这24个层次编织在一起，它利用这些连接线像通道一样，作为一个意识，以量子速度从一个层次移动到另一个层次。然后它把这些经验信息传递给灵魂，灵魂再处理这些传入的数据，以发展它对如何与 "一个计划 "保持一致的理解，并越来越多地把光明带到大多元宇宙的黑暗前哨。

老师。深吸一口气。你已经听得很清楚了。

学生。我说对了吗？

老师。你是关心自己是否正确还是对学习感兴趣？

学生。他们有这么大的区别吗？

老师。他们可以是两极对立的。

学生。我对学习和正确感兴趣。

老师。你在对话开始时问我，是否有一种技术可以获得对上帝的认识。你还记得吗？

学生。是的。

老师。那你发现你的答案了吗？

学生。不，我不认为有答案。

老师。也许有一个答案，但它对每个人都是不同的。所有的生命都在一条独特的道路上接近他们的造物主，这条道路以前从未被人领略过。如果你把你在时间和空间世界中的巨大经验库缝合起来，你认为它曾经被复制过吗？

学生。我不知道。我以前从未想过这个问题。也许在基本层面上，它有。

老师。只有当你把它严重简化时，你才会看到升天的灵魂在通往造物主的领域的道路上有任何相似之处。说实话，我们每个人都是独一无二的，就像大宇宙中的行星一样，正是这种独特性使通用技术无法成为开悟的神奇药丸。

学生。我明白这一点。这是作为设计的一部分来做的吗？

老师。是的。

学生。我想真正的问题是，为了构建我自己的技术以获得对我自己的、多层次的自我的认识，需要什么知识？

老师。如果你的做法是每天早上起床后都进行这样的询问，并且你觉得自己是一块磁铁，通过你经验的每一个方面吸引这些知识进入你的生活，那么你就在路上。

学生。如果我相信幻影核心存在于我体内并吸收这些知识，即使我的意识不在其中，这是否有帮助？

老师：确实如此，也是如此。

学生。我很感激。

老师。非常欢迎你。
