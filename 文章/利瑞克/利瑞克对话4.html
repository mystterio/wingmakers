Lyricus Discourse 4
Universe Relationship
 

Teacher: And so you desire to experience the Wholeness Navigator. Have you decided how?
Student: This is why I wanted to meet with you. I thought you could instruct me on a method, or technique to achieve this.
Teacher: If I could do this, wouldn’t all that exists here (the ashram) be obsolete? Wouldn’t all of your education fall to yourself? Wouldn’t all of your connection to people erode into an existential journey of self-knowledge?
Student: I don’t understand.
Teacher: You have assembled the inner and outer knowledge like a bridge without a middle, and the missing middle section is your experience of that which confirms that the two ends do indeed join; that there is cohesion between these worlds; that the bridge has function. Yes?
Student: Yes.
Teacher: If you found this middle section within your experience, your bridge would be built and you could pass between the inner and outer worlds unencumbered and independent. You would desire to then teach others how to build their own bridges. Yes?
Student: Exactly.
Teacher: Do you think any of the teachers that have lived on earth have built this bridge and not shared it with others?
Student: No.
Teacher: Then where is this technique you speak of? Is it hidden so well that none of the world’s finest teachers can articulate it into a sensible methodology?
Student: Are you saying that none have built this bridge?
Teacher: No. I’m saying that none have wanted to build this bridge.
Student: Then why does it consume me so?
Teacher: Because you believe it can be built by answers, by experience, and by initiative.
Student: And it can’t?
Teacher: It cannot be built anymore than you can build something that is already built.
Student: What do you mean?
Teacher: Can you build this rock? (I was holding a rock I had gathered from the ground.)
Student: Do you mean can I build an exact duplicate?
Teacher: No, I mean this rock?
Student: No. It’s already built.
Teacher: So is your bridge.
Student: Okay… I understand this in concept, but if you’ve never experienced it, what good is it if it’s built?
Teacher: That depends on you.
Student: In what way exactly?
Teacher: Do you see what’s present more than you see what’s missing?
Student: I don’t know… I’m not sure what you mean.
Teacher: You have knowledge and discipline. You have intuition and insight. You have initiative and cunning. You have power of will and persistence. Are these more important to you than the missing conscious experience of the Wholeness Navigator?
Student: I believe that when I have the experience of the Wholeness Navigator, it will supersede these other things or it will put them in some kind of collective order and I will be a better person and therefore a better teacher because of it.
Teacher: But if you cannot build something, how do you teach its construction?
Student: But then you’re saying that I already have this experience and so does everyone else; it’s just that we don’t know it. And again, I realize this in concept, but it seems like some do have this experience.
Teacher: Even at this moment you are having this experience, as am I.
Student: Yes, but you’re probably conscious of it, I’m not.
Teacher: No, I’m conscious of us. I’m conscious of wherever and whatever I turn my attention to. I cannot turn my attention to the Wholeness Navigator because it is of an energetic frequency that is out of the range of the senses of this body and mind.
Student: So you’re saying that the Wholeness Navigator, or human soul is invisible to our human senses no matter what we do? There isn’t any technique that will allow us to attune to it, or it to us?
Teacher: Correct.
Student: So my desire is unfounded?
Teacher: Your desire is natural and well founded; it is just that it will not culminate in the experience you hope for.
Student: Then why do I feel like something vital is missing? Why do I have this nagging belief that my unanswered questions hold me back from my rightful path?
Teacher: As I said before, your attention shifts to what is missing because you have invited the impossible into your world and idealized what others before you achieved in the sharing of their knowledge. You believe that great knowledge can only come from the experience of the unknown, hidden worlds in which the human soul lives, and without this experience you are unable to fulfill your promise.
Student: But many of the greatest teachers shared their vision of these inner worlds and dimensions of which the Wholeness Navigator is a part. If I cannot explore these worlds as they, how can I hope to expand the consciousness of my time?
Teacher: I will share a secret with you. It is not something I do with satisfaction but rather a sense of duty. The accounts of the other worlds are clothed in the very same fabric as dreams. The mystics, saints, and even some of the greatest teachers of the human species lived in bodies with the same limited range of perception as you and I. Their sometimes-spectacular accounts of other dimensions and planes of existence were subjective, non-replicable lucid dreams that were retold as objective worlds of splendor.
Student: Are you saying that the accounts of mysticism are fabrications?
Teacher: Some are. Some are misinterpretations of lucid dreams. Some are encounters with the meta-dimensional worlds of the future multiverse. Some are encounters with off-planetary beings. Some are planned deceptions. The point I’m making is that those who speak loudest of their experiences of the human soul and the worlds in which it resides are often seeking to describe their own glory more than an objective reality.
Student: This will take me a moment to absorb. You seem to be impugning my own teachers, with whom I hold the greatest of respect.
Teacher: I told you that I take no satisfaction in this. Nor am I trying to discredit any teacher. Let me describe it this way. If I discovered a place upon earth that no one else had ever come upon, and I made a map with coordinates of this discovery, I would be able to explain to anyone who can read a map how to find this same place. I could also lead people to it based on my experience.
Why then are there no maps of the inner worlds? And before you answer, remember that while there are maps, they are not consistent in scale or measure, and thus, they do not describe the same inner geography.
Student: I agree there is incongruity about the structure of the multiverse, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that it doesn’t exist.
Teacher: I’m not suggesting that it doesn’t exist. There is no map! There are no cartographers of these worlds because these worlds are infinite in scope. How do you map the infinities of First Source? With paper and pen? How do you reduce the extraordinary vision of our collective Creator to words and methodologies?
Student: Are you saying it’s all impossible—this desire to experience the inner dimensions of my being?
Teacher: The best teachers allow for the possibility, and at the same time never consider it missing in their lives. The fascination of phenomenon is replaced with the consent of the real qualities of the human spirit to shine through their countenance, words, and deeds, and to do so with their unique personality intact.
Student: How then can the consciousness evolve if every generation teaches nothing new about the inner worlds? Or worse yet, only adds to the confusion of how these worlds operate within our consciousness?
Teacher: As I said before, the bridge, or consciousness, in this case, is built. It cannot be evolved, improved or enhanced. It is a multi-faceted consciousness that is as far beyond the human mind as the boundaries of the universe are beyond earth. The appreciation of this consciousness is what requires evolution; and its application as a source of guidance and inspiration is what requires instruction.
Student: Exactly what I wanted to get to. This is precisely what I want to teach, but if I myself have no experience of this super-consciousness, how can I help others to evolve their appreciation?
Teacher: You have been asking for help to experience something that cannot be experienced, instead of choosing to tell the universe what you want to appreciate.
Student: I don’t understand.
Teacher: The universe responds to your directives, not your questions, hopes, and prayers. If you choose to define your future by telling the universe what you desire to experience and appreciate, and you hold these thoughts in your mind with fierce persistence, the universe—by its own design—will respond accordingly. If, on the other hand, you ask questions and pray for answers, the universe will respond with a deafening silence because you have not given it direction.
Student: This is the co-creative process you speak of, and I understand the principles of this, but how does it relate to my desire to expand my understanding of consciousness and teach this understanding to others?
Teacher: Desire is not a directive. Simply desiring to achieve something does not engage the universe; it engages your personal power and applies your will to achieve a goal. Praying, as it was originally intended, held two complementary purposes: To demonstrate to the universe that an individual made choices regarding their destiny, and expressing gratitude to the universe for its unfailing support.
Student: Given what you’ve said, I assume it doesn’t make sense to make a directive to the universe that I want it to bring me the personal experience of the Wholeness Navigator?
Teacher: You can make any directive you select. The universe is not obligated to respond, it simply does. By your selection the universe knows you. You are revealed in this simple act, and through this intimacy, the universe will respond in kind and reveal itself.
If you direct the universe to bring you the experience of the Wholeness Navigator, it will bring you this experience, but you will not have consciousness recollection because, as I’ve said before, the signature vibration of the Wholeness Navigator is not perceptible to the human senses or mind. There is no method to capture the experience—the mind is like a camera, but the senses—the film—are not present.
Student: So the universe responds according to the directive, but I may think it wasn’t listening because I don’t recall the experience?
Teacher: Yes. It is a frequent occurrence with higher dimensional directives, something akin to a perceptual omission. The condition can create resentment and an uneasy sense that the universe is indifferent or even malfunctioning, despite the fact that most individuals consider the breakdown to be their own fault—at least consciously. However, in most students, lurking below the guilt of the conscious mind is the sense that the universe is indifferent, or even worse, purposely non-responsive.
Student: How do I direct the universe? Is it a forceful command?
Teacher: Each individual is a creator of his or her wisdom path. As such, they must create the priority and structure of their path on their own. They may tap resources like teachers or books, but the creation of the path is their own, regardless of the external circumstances such as religious conformity. Once this is understood and internalized, it becomes the foundation from which you operate. This is one’s spiritual duty, and it is the first step on the path of co-creation with the universe.
The second step upon this path is the informed assignment of priority. There is a sequence to all directions—an order in which they build to an end goal or achievement.
Student: Please explain how this applies to spiritual revelation?
Teacher: When you have a goal to comprehend your identity—not only as a human being but also as a spirit-fragment of First Source, you must break your goal into component building blocks, and see the order within the process. Underlying this order is the fluidity that provides for rapid transformation and adaptation. Once this is defined you direct the universe to respond to this plan by the simple and persistent act of defining and, most importantly, re-defining it. The thought uppermost in your mind is that the universe is “eavesdropping” on your plans, and shifting, or re-arranging your material, emotional, mental, and spiritual environments in direct response to its observations. It does this without regard to what you would call your worthiness. It does this because it is its nature.
Student: What if my plans are just plain wrong or ill conceived?
Teacher: You will most likely be frustrated or unsatisfied by the events that unfold.
Student: Can you give me an example?
Teacher: If someone plans to begin their teaching profession before they have adequately trained as a student, and the universe responds in kind by providing them students, they may perpetuate their own misunderstandings upon those they teach. This is a common example for would-be teachers of the spiritual arts.
Student: But what you said earlier, about defining your plan and its order, if you truly did this properly would you not avoid the ill-conceived plan?
Teacher: The universe watches faithfully your every movement and emotional connection to your goal. The ability to avoid the ill-conceived plan rests mostly in the discovery of your original voice—sorted out from the thousands of voices that have influenced you—and to allow this voice to define and direct your approach to your divinity. It is this voice and the judgment and insight behind it that places you and retains you in the security of the universe.
Student: But there are so many more insightful than I. Why would I listen to my own voice amid those of my teachers?
Teacher: Do you listen to your teachers, or do you compare their words with what resonates with what you sense is true?
Student: To be candid, I compare their words with my own sense of truth.
Teacher: So you already listen to your own voice?
Student: In a way, I suppose. But I use my voice as a ruler, measuring the words of my teachers with my intuition or… or some related faculty. I don’t originate the thought or idea—I simply evaluate it.
Teacher: And why do you do this? Why do you assign yourself the diminished role of measuring and analyzing instead of creating and invention?
Student: Because I am inexperienced and lack knowledge.
Teacher: But you just agreed that you have experience in evaluating the substance of your instruction—that you can perceive the truth and value of an instruction, principle or suggestion.
Student: Yes, but it is one thing to have the knowledge and skill of evaluation, and quite another to be able to invent or perceive the knowledge of truth within oneself.
Teacher: Why?
Student: I’m not sure that I know how to explain this.
Teacher: The knowledge that will transform you derives from your personal experience of two fundamental phenomena: the Light and Sound vibrations of First Source.
Student:Exactly, and how to achieve this experiential knowledge of the Light and Sound requires expert instruction—the kind that only the highest spiritual teacher can supply.
Teacher: Do you appreciate the transformation of consciousness? Is it something you have directed the Universe to supply, or are you waiting for a teacher to take you by the hand and lead you to the Light and Sound? In other words, are you waiting to evaluate the instruction of a human being, or are you directing the Universe to supply this experience?
Student: I came here, to this ashram, to learn how to experience the Light and Sound of First Source so I can bring this knowledge to others.
Teacher: So you are waiting for a human being.
Student: Perhaps this is the way the Universe would respond to my directive, to bring me a teacher who can show me the way.
Teacher: The Universe and you are the teacher. Together you are the active, unswerving, tireless, ceaseless, on-demand pathway that can provide the direct experience. Or, you can wait for the Universe to send you messengers clothed in human form who are less active, direct, energized, responsive, and enduring—if that is your choice… your directive.
Student: So you’re telling me to become more of an active partner with the Universe.
Teacher: Add responsibility and acceptance of your capacity to partner with the Universe, and you have properly evaluated my instruction.
Student: But I feel as if you’re suggesting that teachers do not serve a role in this process. Is this true?
Teacher: Everyone upon your life-path will serve a role in this—teachers included. The Universe will arrange the right words, the right sounds, the right light, the right meaning to enter your life-path, and these will come through nature, humans, animals, technology, and combinations thereof. The process, the Universe, and you are inseparable when properly directed.
Student: So the real knowledge is knowing how to direct the Universe?
Teacher: It is the one relationship you will have that is responsive to the impressions of your thoughts and the expressions of your heart. You can direct it and it will respond.
Student: What is the key to directing the Universe?
Teacher: To feel in union and harmony with the Universe. To truly feel that the Universe flows through you and in doing so creates the life-path upon which you walk. To trust this life-path, knowing it is a co-creation between you and the Universe, and to demonstrate this trust in matters small and large. Assuming all of these foundations are in place, then it is merely articulating the highest possible expression of your deepest heart.
Student: How do I come to know this?
Teacher: You listen to your original voice. You allow it to be expansive, mysterious, paradoxical, boundless, and joyful. When you give this part of you an opportunity to express itself, it will articulate the innermost yearning of your heart and soul, and it is to these yearnings that the Universe is most attuned to hear and respond to.
Student: But doesn’t the Universe also respond to our thoughts and prayers?
Teacher: There are those who will tell you that you can ask the Universe for abundance, health, good relations, new job, and anything else your mind desires, and it will respond to your wishes. The Universe is neutral to your material status within the worlds of form. How successful you are as a human being—measured by the system of men—is not the concern of the Universe, it is the concern of the socially trained mind and ego.
Student: But there are practical implications of this partnership with the Universe aren’t there?
Teacher: If your highest aspirations from the deepest part of you are being supported by the Universe, you are more likely to succeed in your material quest for prosperity and right relations—for the two are related, are they not?
Student: Yes.
Teacher: However, those of power devise the system within the worlds of form, and it is this power that dictates the definition of prosperity. The Universe is not involved in these matters, it is humans in power who define such things, and the Universe is not aligned to these definitions.
Student: So the two paths are not compatible?
Teacher: What two paths are you referring to?
Student: The petitions of human prosperity and practical survival, and the aspirations of my highest self.
Teacher: There is no inherent incompatibility. It is simply a matter of where you place your focus and how you define prosperity, right relations, success, and so forth. If you try to direct the Universe toward the field of human prosperity and material concerns, do so with the understanding that the Universe is indifferent about these concerns, and you are really petitioning the Genetic Mind, not the Universe. You may receive some support from the Genetic Mind and psychic influences therein, but generally it does not supplant the time-honored system of practice, persistence, creation, evolution, and patience.
Student: I think I understand your counsel. Thank you for your advice.
Teacher: You are most welcome.

宇宙关系
 

老师。所以你渴望体验 "整体性导航"。你决定怎么做了吗？
学生。这就是我想和你见面的原因。我想你可以指导我用一种方法或技巧来实现这个目标。
老师：如果我能做到这一点，那么这里（修行院）的一切不就都过时了吗？你所有的教育不是都落在你自己身上吗？你与人的所有联系不就会被侵蚀成自我认识的存在之旅吗？
学生。我不明白。
老师。你把内在和外在的知识组合在一起，就像一座没有中间的桥，而缺少的中间部分是你的经验，它证实了两端确实是连接在一起的；这些世界之间有凝聚力；桥有功能。是吗？
学生。是的。
老师：如果你在你的经验中找到了这个中间部分，你的桥梁就会建立起来，你就可以无拘无束、独立地通过内在和外在世界。然后你会渴望教别人如何建立他们自己的桥梁。是吗？
学生。正是如此。
老师。你认为在地球上生活过的老师中，有谁搭建了这座桥而没有与他人分享吗？
学生。没有。
老师。那么你说的这个技术在哪里呢？它隐藏得如此之好，以至于世界上最优秀的教师都无法将其表述为一种合理的方法论吗？
学生。你是说没有人建造过这座桥吗？
老师。不，我是说，没有人想建这座桥。
学生。那么，为什么它如此消耗我？
老师。因为你相信它可以通过答案、通过经验、通过主动性来建立。
学生。它不能？
老师：它不能被建造，就像你不能建造已经建成的东西一样。
学生。你是什么意思？
老师。你能建造这块石头吗？（我拿着一块从地上捡来的石头。）
学生。你的意思是我可以建立一个完全相同的副本吗？
老师。不，我是说这块石头？
学生。不，它已经建成了。
老师。你的桥也是如此。
学生。好的......我在概念上理解这一点，但如果你没有经历过，如果建立了又有什么用？
老师。这取决于你。
学生。到底是以什么方式？
老师。你看到现在的东西多于看到缺失的东西吗？
学生。我不知道......我不确定你的意思。
老师。你有知识和修养。你有直觉和洞察力。你有主动性和狡猾性。你有意志力和坚持不懈的精神。对你来说，这些比缺失的 "整体性导航 "的意识经验更重要吗？
学生。我相信，当我有了 "整体性导航仪 "的经验后，它将取代这些其他的东西，或者它将把它们放在某种集体秩序中，我将成为一个更好的人，因此也是一个更好的老师。
老师。但如果你不能建造某样东西，你怎么教它的构造呢？
学生。但你的意思是，我已经有这种经验，其他人也有；只是我们不知道而已。再说一遍，我在概念上意识到这一点，但似乎有些人确实有这种经验。
老师。甚至在这一刻，你和我一样都有这种体验。
学生。是的，但你可能意识到了，我没有。
老师。不，我对我们有意识。我对任何地方和任何我关注的事物都有意识。我不能把我的注意力转向 "整体性导航仪"，因为它的能量频率超出了这个身体和心灵的感官范围。
学生。所以你是说，无论我们做什么，人类的灵魂都是看不见的？没有任何技术能让我们适应它，或让它适应我们？
老师。正确。
学生。所以我的愿望是没有根据的？
老师。你的愿望是自然的，也是有根据的；只是它不会在你希望的经验中达到高潮。
学生。那为什么我觉得缺少一些重要的东西呢？为什么我有这种唠叨的信念，认为我未回答的问题阻碍了我走正道？
老师。正如我之前所说的，你的注意力转移到了缺失的东西上，因为你把不可能的东西请进了你的世界，并把你之前的人在分享知识时取得的成就理想化了。你相信伟大的知识只能来自于对人类灵魂所处的未知、隐秘世界的体验，而没有这种体验，你就无法实现你的承诺。
学生。但许多最伟大的老师分享了他们对这些内在世界和维度的看法，"整体性导航 "是其中的一部分。如果我不能像他们那样探索这些世界，我怎么能希望扩大我的时代意识？
教师：我将与你们分享一个秘密。我这样做并不是为了满足，而是出于一种责任感。对其他世界的描述与梦境一样，都是以相同的织物为载体。神秘主义者、圣人，甚至是人类最伟大的老师都生活在和你我一样感知范围有限的身体里。他们有时对其他维度和存在平面的壮观描述是主观的、不可复制的清醒梦境，被复述为客观的辉煌世界。
学生。你是说神秘主义的说法是捏造的吗？
老师。有些是。有些是对清醒梦境的误解。有些是与未来多元宇宙的元维世界的相遇。有些是与星外生命的相遇。有些是有计划的欺骗。我想说的是，那些最大声地谈论他们对人类灵魂和它所居住的世界的体验的人，往往是在寻求描述他们自己的荣耀，而不是一个客观的现实。
学生。这需要我花点时间来消化。你似乎在指责我自己的老师，我对他们抱有极大的尊重。
老师：我告诉过你，我对此并不满意。我也不是要诋毁任何老师。让我这样来描述它。如果我在地球上发现了一个别人从未遇到过的地方，并且我用这个发现的坐标绘制了一张地图，我就能够向任何能够读懂地图的人解释如何找到这个地方。我也可以根据我的经验带领人们找到它。
那么为什么没有内部世界的地图呢？在你回答之前，请记住，虽然有地图，但它们的比例和尺度并不一致，因此，它们并不描述相同的内在地理环境。
学生。我同意多元宇宙的结构有不协调之处，但这不一定意味着它不存在。
老师：我并不是说它不存在。没有地图！没有地图。没有这些世界的制图师，因为这些世界的范围是无限的。你如何绘制第一源泉的无限性？用纸和笔吗？你如何将我们集体的造物主的非凡愿景还原为文字和方法论？
学生。你是说这一切都不可能--这种体验我内在维度的愿望？
老师。最好的老师允许这种可能性，同时也从不认为他们的生活中缺少这种可能性。对现象的迷恋被同意人类精神的真正品质通过他们的面容、言语和行为发光所取代，并以他们独特的个性完整地做到这一点。
学生。如果每一代人都没有教给我们关于内在世界的新知识，那么意识怎么能进化？或者更糟糕的是，只是增加了这些世界在我们意识中如何运作的困惑？
老师。正如我之前所说，在这种情况下，桥梁或意识已经建成。它不能被进化、改进或加强。它是一种多方面的意识，它超越了人类的思维，就像宇宙的边界超越了地球一样。对这种意识的欣赏是需要进化的；而它作为指导和灵感的来源的应用是需要指导的。
学生。正是我想达到的目的。这正是我想教的，但如果我自己对这种超级意识没有经验，我怎么能帮助别人发展他们的鉴赏力？
老师。你一直在请求帮助来体验一些无法体验的东西，而不是选择告诉宇宙你想要欣赏的东西。
学生。我不明白。
老师。宇宙对你的指令做出反应，而不是你的问题、希望和祈祷。如果你选择通过告诉宇宙你想要体验和欣赏的东西来定义你的未来，并且你以强烈的毅力在你的脑海中坚持这些想法，宇宙--根据它自己的设计--将作出相应的反应。另一方面，如果你提出问题并祈求答案，宇宙将以震耳欲聋的沉默回应，因为你没有给它指明方向。
学生。这就是你说的共同创造过程，我理解其中的原则，但它与我想扩大对意识的理解并把这种理解教给别人的愿望有什么关系？
老师。欲望不是一种指令。仅仅渴望实现某件事情并不能让宇宙参与进来；它涉及到你的个人力量，运用你的意志来实现目标。祈祷，正如它的初衷，有两个互补的目的。向宇宙证明个人对自己的命运做出了选择，并对宇宙的不懈支持表示感谢。
学生。鉴于你所说的，我想向宇宙发出指令，希望它给我带来整体性导航仪的个人体验是没有意义的？
老师。你可以做出任何你选择的指令。宇宙没有义务做出回应，它只是做出回应。通过你的选择，宇宙了解你。你在这个简单的行为中被揭示出来，通过这种亲密关系，宇宙将作出回应，并揭示自己。
如果你指示宇宙给你带来整体性导航仪的体验，它会给你带来这种体验，但你不会有意识的回忆，因为正如我之前所说，整体性导航仪的标志性振动是人类的感官或头脑所不能感知的。没有任何方法可以捕捉到这种体验--头脑就像一台相机，但感官--胶片--并不存在。
学生。所以宇宙根据指令做出反应，但我可能认为它没有听，因为我不记得有这个经历？
老师。是的。这是在高维指令中经常出现的情况，类似于感知上的遗漏。这种情况会产生怨恨和不安的感觉，认为宇宙无动于衷，甚至出现故障，尽管大多数人认为故障是他们自己的错--至少是有意识的。然而，在大多数学生中，潜伏在有意识的罪恶感之下的是宇宙无动于衷的感觉，甚至更糟的是，故意不回应。
学生。我如何指挥宇宙？是强硬的命令吗？
老师。每个人都是他或她智慧道路的创造者。因此，他们必须自己创造自己道路的优先权和结构。他们可以利用教师或书籍等资源，但道路的创造是他们自己的，不管外部环境如何，如宗教的一致性。一旦理解并内化了这一点，它就成为你运作的基础。这是一个人的精神责任，也是与宇宙共同创造道路的第一步。
这条道路上的第二步是对优先权的知情分配。所有的方向都有一个顺序--一个建立在最终目标或成就上的顺序。
学生。请解释这如何适用于精神启示？
老师。当你有一个目标来理解你的身份--不仅是作为一个人，而且是作为第一源泉的精神碎片，你必须把你的目标分解成各个组成部分，并看到这个过程中的秩序。这种秩序的基础是为快速转变和适应提供的流动性。一旦确定了这一点，你就通过简单而持久的定义和最重要的重新定义，引导宇宙对这个计划做出反应。你脑海中最重要的想法是，宇宙正在 "偷听 "你的计划，并根据它的观察，转变或重新安排你的物质、情感、心理和精神环境。它这样做不考虑你所说的你的价值。它这样做是因为这是它的本性。
学生。如果我的计划完全错误或构思不当怎么办？
老师。你很可能会对展开的事件感到沮丧或不满意。
学生。你能给我举个例子吗？
教师：如果有人在接受充分的学生培训之前就计划开始他们的教师职业，而宇宙以提供学生的方式回应他们，他们可能会将自己的误解延续到他们所教的人身上。这是一个常见的例子，即将成为精神艺术的教师。
学生。但是你刚才说的，关于确定你的计划和它的顺序，如果你真正正确地做到了这一点，你会不会避免不周全的计划？
老师。宇宙忠实地观察着你的每一个动作和与你目标的情感联系。避免计划不周的能力主要在于发现你最初的声音--从成千上万的影响你的声音中筛选出来--并允许这个声音定义和指导你接近你的神性。正是这个声音和它背后的判断力和洞察力将你置于宇宙的安全中并将你保留下来。
学生。但有那么多比我更有见地的人，我为什么要在老师们的声音中听自己的声音？
老师。你是否听从你的老师，或者你将他们的话与你感觉到的真实的东西进行比较？
学生。坦率地说，我把他们的话与我自己的真理感进行比较。
老师。所以你已经在听自己的声音了？
学生。在某种程度上，我想。但我把我的声音当作一把尺子，用我的直觉或......或一些相关的能力来衡量我老师的话。我不是思想或想法的始作俑者，我只是评估它。
老师。你为什么要这样做呢？为什么你给自己分配的角色是测量和分析而不是创造和发明？
学生。因为我没有经验，缺乏知识。
老师。但是你刚才同意你有评估你的指导内容的经验--你可以感知到一个指导、原则或建议的真理和价值。
学生。是的，但是拥有评估的知识和技能是一回事，而能够在自己的内心发明或感知真理的知识又是另一回事。
老师。为什么？
学生。我不确定我是否知道如何解释这个问题。
老师。将改变你的知识来自于你对两个基本现象的个人体验：第一源的光和声音振动。
学生：没错，如何实现这种对光和声音的体验性知识，需要专家的指导--只有最高的精神导师才能提供的那种指导。
老师。你欣赏意识的转变吗？这是你指示宇宙提供的东西，还是你在等待老师牵着你的手，把你引向光明和声音？换句话说，你是在等待评估人类的指导，还是在引导宇宙提供这种经验？
学生。我来到这里，来到这个修行院，是为了学习如何体验第一源泉的光和声音，这样我就可以把这种知识带给其他人。
老师。所以你在等待一个人。
学生。也许这就是宇宙对我的指令的回应方式，给我带来一位能给我指明方向的老师。
老师。宇宙和你是老师。你们一起是积极的、坚定不移的、不知疲倦的、不间断的、按需的途径，可以提供直接经验。或者，你可以等待宇宙给你送来披着人类外衣的信使，他们不那么积极、直接、有活力、有反应和持久--如果这是你的选择......你的指令。
学生。所以你是在告诉我，要更多地成为宇宙的积极伙伴。
老师。加上责任和接受你与宇宙合作的能力，你已经正确评价了我的教学。
学生。但我觉得你好像在暗示，教师在这个过程中没有起到作用。这是真的吗？
老师。在你的生命之路上的每一个人都将在其中发挥作用，包括教师。宇宙将安排正确的语言、正确的声音、正确的光线、正确的意义进入你的生命之路，这些将通过自然、人类、动物、技术和它们的组合来实现。在正确的指导下，这个过程、宇宙和你是密不可分的。
学生。所以真正的知识是知道如何引导宇宙？
老师：这是你将拥有的一种关系，它对你思想的印象和你内心的表达有反应。你可以指挥它，它也会做出反应。
学生。指挥宇宙的关键是什么？
老师。感受与宇宙的结合与和谐。真正感受到宇宙在你身上流动，并以此创造了你行走的生命之路。相信这条生命之路，知道它是你和宇宙之间的共同创造，并在大大小小的事情上展示这种信任。假设所有这些基础都到位了，那么它只是阐明了你最深的心的最高可能的表达。
学生。我怎么会知道这些呢？
老师。你倾听你最初的声音。你允许它是宽广的、神秘的、矛盾的、无限的和快乐的。当你给你的这部分人一个机会来表达自己时，它就会表达出你内心深处的渴望，而宇宙正是对这些渴望最善于聆听和回应的。
学生。但宇宙不也对我们的想法和祈祷做出反应吗？
老师。有些人会告诉你，你可以向宇宙要求富足、健康、良好的关系、新的工作，以及其他任何你心目中的愿望，它都会回应你的愿望。宇宙对你在形式世界中的物质地位是中立的。你作为一个人有多成功--由人的系统来衡量--不是宇宙关心的问题，而是社会培训的头脑和自我关心的问题。
学生。但与宇宙的这种伙伴关系有实际意义，不是吗？
老师：如果你来自内心深处的最高愿望得到了宇宙的支持，你就更有可能在物质上追求繁荣和正确的关系上取得成功--这两者是相关的，不是吗？
学生。是的。
老师：然而，那些有权力的人设计了形式世界中的系统，正是这种权力决定了繁荣的定义。宇宙并不参与这些事情，是有权力的人在定义这些事情，而宇宙并不与这些定义保持一致。
学生。所以这两条路是不相容的？
老师。你指的是哪两条路？
学生。人类繁荣和实际生存的请愿，以及我最高自我的愿望。
老师。没有什么内在的不相容性。这只是一个你把注意力放在哪里，以及你如何定义繁荣、正确的关系、成功等等的问题。如果你试图把宇宙引向人类繁荣和物质关注的领域，那么你要明白，宇宙对这些关注是无动于衷的，你实际上是在向遗传心灵请愿，而不是向宇宙请愿。你可能会从遗传心智和其中的精神影响中得到一些支持，但一般来说，它不会取代实践、坚持、创造、进化和耐心等历史悠久的系统。
学生。我想我明白你的建议。谢谢你的建议。
老师。非常欢迎你。
