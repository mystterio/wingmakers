Chamber One – Life Principles of the Sovereign Integral
The entity model of expression is designed to explore new fields of vibration through biological instruments and transform through this process of discovery to a new level of understanding and expression as a Sovereign Integral. The Sovereign Integral is the fullest expression of the entity model within the time-space universes, and most closely exemplifies Source Intelligence’s capabilities therein. It is also the natural state of existence of the entity that has transformed beyond the evolution/saviorship model of existence and has removed itself from the controlling aspects of the Hierarchy through the complete activation of its embedded Source Codes. This is the level of capability that was “seeded” within the entity model of expression when it was initially conceived by First Source. All entities within the time-space universes are in various stages of the transformational experience and each is destined to achieve the Sovereign Integral level as their Source Codes become fully activated.
The transformational experience is the realization that the entity model of expression is capable of direct access to Source Intelligence information, and that the information of First Source is discovered within the entity level of the Sovereign Integral. In other words, the human instrument, complete with its biological, emotional, and mental capabilities, is not the repository of the entity’s Source Codes. Nor is the human instrument able to reach out and gather in this liberating information—this glorious freedom to access All That Is. It is the entity that is both the harbor of, and instrument of access to, the Source Coding activation that permits the transformational experience to manifest through the integration of the human instrument and the sovereign entity.

The transformational experience consists of the realization that perceived reality is Source Reality personified in the form of individual preferences. Thus, Source Reality and sovereign reality become as inseparable as the wind and air. This confluence is realized only through the transformational experience, which is unlike anything known within the time-space universes.

There have been those upon terra-earth who have experienced a shallow breath of wind from this powerful tempest. Some have called it ascension; others have attributed names like illumination, vision, enlightenment, nirvana, and cosmic consciousness. While these experiences are profound in human standards, they are only the initial stirrings of the Sovereign Integral, as it becomes increasingly adept at touching and awakening the remote edges of its existence. What most species define as the ultimate bliss is merely the impression of the Sovereign Integral whispering to its outposts of form and nudging them to look within to their roots of existence and unite with this formless and limitless intelligence that pervades all.

The transformational experience is far beyond the calibration of the human drama much like the stars in the sky are beyond the touch of terra-earth. You can observe the stars with your human eyes, but you will never touch them with your human hands. Similarly, you can dimly foresee the transformational experience with the human instrument, but you cannot experience it through the human instrument. It is only accessed through the wholeness of the entity, for it is only in wholeness that the Source Codes and their residual effects of Source Reality perception can exist. And truly, this wholeness is only obtained when the individual consciousness is separated from time and is able to view its existence in timelessness.

Nevertheless, the human instrument is critical in facilitating the transformational experience and causing it to trigger—like a metamorphosis—the integration of the formful identities into the Sovereign Integral. This is the next stage of perception and expression for the entity model, and it is activated when the entity designs its reality from life principles that are symbolic of Source Reality, as opposed to the reality of an external source that is bound to the evolution/saviorship model of existence.

These life principles are Source Intelligence templates of creation. They are designed to create reality from the perspective of the Sovereign Integral and hasten its manifestation within the fields of vibration that have thus far repelled it. They are principles that construct opportunities for the integration of the entity’s formless and formful identities. They are bridges that the human instrument—with all its componentry intact—can use to experience the Sovereign Integral perception of wholeness.

As the human instrument becomes increasingly responsive to Source Intelligence it will gravitate to life principles that symbolically express the formative principles of prime creation. There are wide ranges of expressions that can induce the transformational experience of the Sovereign Integral and liberate the entity from time-space conditioning and external controls. Inasmuch as the expression can vary, the intent of the expression is quite narrowly defined as the intent to expand into a state of integration whereby the human instrument becomes increasingly aligned with the Sovereign Integral perspective.

There are three particular life principles that accelerate the transformational experience and help to align the human instrument with the Sovereign Integral perspective. They are:

1) Universe relationship through gratitude

2) Observance of Source in all things

3) Nurturance of life

When the individual applies these principles, their life experience reveals a deeper meaning to its apparently random events—both in the universal and personal contexts.

 

Universe Relationship through Gratitude

This is the principle that the Universe of Wholeness represents a collective intelligence that can be personalized as a single Universal Entity. Thus, in this model of inference, there are only two entities in the entire cosmos: the individual entity and the Universal Entity. Inasmuch as the individual is impressionable and constantly changing to adapt to new information, so is the Universal Entity, which is a dynamic and living template of potential energies and experiences that are coherent and as knowable as a friend’s personality and behavior.

The Universal Entity is responsive to the individual and its perceptions and expressions. It is like a composite omni-personality that is imbued with Source Intelligence and responds to the perceptions of the individual like a pool of water mirrors the image that overshadows it. Everyone in a human instrument is indeed, at their innermost core, a sovereign entity that can transform the human instrument into an instrument of the Sovereign Integral. However, this transformation is dependent on whether the individual chooses to project an image of a Sovereign Integral upon the “mirror” of the Universal Entity, or project a lesser image that is a distortion of its true state of being.

The principle of universe relationship through gratitude is primarily concerned with consciously designing one’s self image through an appreciation of the Universal Entity’s supportive “mirror”. In other words, the Universal Entity is a partner in shaping reality’s expression in one’s life. Reality is an internal process of creation that is utterly free of external controls and conditions if the individual projects a sovereign image upon the mirror of the Universal Entity.

This process is an interchange of supportive energy from the individual to the Universal Entity, and this energy is best applied through an appreciation of how perfectly and exactingly the interchange occurs in every moment of life. If the individual is aware (or at least interested in having the awareness) of how perfectly the Universal Entity supports the individual’s sovereign reality, then a powerful and natural sense of gratitude flows from the individual to the Universal Entity. It is this wellspring of gratitude that opens the channel of support from the Universal Entity to the individual and establishes a collaboration of purpose to transform the human instrument into an expression of the Sovereign Integral.

It is principally gratitude—which translates to an appreciation of how the inter-relationship of the individual and the Universal Entity operates—that opens the human instrument to its connection to the sovereign entity and its eventual transformation into the Sovereign Integral state of perception and expression. The relationship of the individual with the Universal Entity is essential to cultivate and nurture, because it, more than anything else, determines how accepting the individual is to life’s myriad forms and manifestations.

When the individual accepts changes in sovereign reality as the shifting persona of the Universal Entity, they live in greater harmony with life itself. Life becomes an exchange of energy between the individual and the Universal Entity that is allowed to play out without judgment and experienced without fear. This is the underlying meaning of unconditional love: to experience life in all its manifestations as a single, unified intelligence that responds perfectly to the projected image of the human instrument.

It is for this reason that when the human instrument projects gratitude to the Universal Entity, regardless of circumstance or condition, life becomes increasingly supportive in opening the human instrument to activate its Source Codes and live life within the framework of the synthesis model of expression. The feeling of gratitude coupled with the mental concept of appreciation is expressed like an invisible message in all directions and at all times. In this particular context, gratitude to the Universal Entity is the overarching motive behind all forms of expression that the human instrument aspires to.

Every breath, every word, every touch, every thought, every thing is centered on expressing this sense of gratitude. A gratitude that the individual is sovereign and supported by a Universal Entity that expresses itself through all forms and manifestations of intelligence with the sole objective of creating the ideal reality to activate the individual’s Source Codes and transform the human instrument and entity into the Sovereign Integral. It is this specific form of gratitude that accelerates the activation of the Source Codes and their peculiar ability to integrate the disparate componentry of the human instrument and the entity, and transform them to the state of perception and expression of the Sovereign Integral.

Time is the only factor that distorts this otherwise clear connection between the individual and Universal Entity. Time intervenes and creates pockets of despair, hopelessness, and abandonment. However, it is these very “pockets” that often activate the Source Codes of the entity and establish a more intimate and harmonious relationship with the Universal Entity. Time establishes separation of experience, and the perceived discontinuity of reality, which in turn creates doubt in the Universal Entity’s system of fairness and overarching purpose. The result creates fear that the universe is not a mirror, but rather a chaotic, whimsical energy.

When the human instrument is aligned with the Sovereign Integral and lives from this perspective as a developing reality, it attracts a natural state of harmony. This does not necessarily mean that the human instrument is without problems or discomforts, rather it signifies a perception that there is an integral purpose in what life reveals. In other words, natural harmony perceives that life experience is meaningful to the extent you are aligned with the Sovereign Integral, and that your personal reality must flow from this strata of the multidimensional universe in order to create lasting joy and inner peace.

Gratitude is a critical facet of love that opens the human instrument to acknowledge the role of the Universal Entity and redefine its purpose as a supportive extension of sovereign reality, rather than the whimsical outreach of fate or the exacting reaction of a mechanical, detached universe. Establishing a relationship with the Universal Entity through the outflow of gratitude also attracts life experience that is transformative. Experience that is richly devoted to uncovering life’s deepest meaning and most formative purpose.

 

Observance of Source in All Things

This is the principle that First Source is present in all realities through all manifestations of energy. IT is interwoven in all things like a mosaic whose pieces adhere to the same wall, and are thus, unified. However, it is not the picture that unifies the mosaic, but the wall upon which its pieces adhere. Similarly, First Source paints a picture so diverse and apparently unrelated that there appears to be no unification. Yet it is not the outward manifestations that unify, it is the inward center of energy upon which the pieces of diversity are layered that unifies all manifestations.

This centerpiece of energy is the collective storehouse of all life in all fields of vibration within the Universe of Wholeness. It is First Source who divests ITSELF in all forms through the projection of ITS Source Intelligence in to all fragments of life. Thus, Source Intelligence—acting as an extension of First Source—is the unifying energy that is the “wall” upon which all the pieces of life’s mosaic adhere. Life flows from one energy Source that links all to All and one to One.

Observance of Source in All Things is the principle that all manifestations of life convey an expression of First Source. It does not matter how far the unifying energy has been distorted or perverted; the Source can be observed. It is the action of perceiving the unification of energy even when the outward manifestations appear random, distorted, unrelated, or chaotic.

When all manifestations of life are genuinely perceived as fragmentary expressions of First Source, the vibration of equality that underlies all life-forms becomes perceptible to the human instrument. Life initially emerges as an extension of Source Reality, and then, as an individuated energy frequency invested within a form. It vibrates, in its pure, timeless state, precisely the same for all manifestations of life. This is the common ground that all life shares. This is the tone-vibration of equality that can be observed within all life forms that unifies all expressions of diversity to the foundation of existence known as First Source. If an individual is able to look upon any form of life with the outlook of equality, then they are observing Source in all things.

While this may seem like an abstract concept, it is actualized through the practice of looking for the outward and inward manifestations of First Source. In a very real sense, the individual expects to observe the workings of Source Intelligence in every facet of their experience. It is the unassailable expectation that everything is in its rightful position, performing its optimal function, and serving its purpose to activate the fullest expression of its life in the present moment. It is the outlook that all life is in a state of optimal realization and experience regardless of condition or circumstance. It is the perception that life is perfect in its expression because it flows from perfection, and that no matter how divergent its manifestations are, life is an extension of Source Reality.

In light of the obvious turmoil and apparent destruction that accompanies life on terra-earth, this is an outlook or perception that seems naive. How can life—in all its forms and expressions—be perceived as optimal or perfect? This is the great paradox of life, and it cannot be reconciled with the human instrument’s mental or emotional capabilities. It can only be understood in the context of the entity, which is deathless, limitless, timeless, and sovereign. Paradoxes exist because the human drama is too limited in scope and scale to allow a perception of wholeness to intervene and illuminate how the pieces of the puzzle are unified in perfect relation.

The dimensions of time and space and the elements of energy and matter circumscribe the human drama. It is played out upon the stages of survival and dysfunctional behavior because of the Hierarchy’s methods of controlling information and manipulating conditions. The entity within the human instrument is largely unexpressed and under-utilized in the human drama, and therefore, life’s apparent perversions and imperfections are seen in isolation as impediments to perfection rather than perfection itself.

Life is perfect in its resolve to expand and express an intelligence that is limitless. This is the fundamental purpose of life in all its diverse manifestations, and this is the presence of First Source—expressing ITSELF as a vibration of equality—that can be observed in all things. Sensory input derived from the human instrument is limited to frequencies in specific ranges that only convey an echo of this Source vibration. The true frequency is understood through deliberate and focused contemplation of equality inherent in all things, and the ability to penetrate beyond the picture of a thing to the origin of the picture.

These insights require a new sensory system beyond the five-senses that rule the human world in your time. These new senses are the outgrowth of the Source Code activation, and represent the first stage of the transformation experience. With this new perceptual ability, the human instrument will be capable of sensing not only the presence of First Source, but also the timeless essence within all life that is individualized and uniquely separate from First Source.

Calling forth the perceptions of the entity within the human instrument is the ideal method to access a lasting sensitivity to the Source vibration. This is how an individual can develop the ability to observe Source in all things. It is not only that First Source is within every individual manifestation of energy, but is also the wholeness of life itself. Thus, the principle requires an observance of Source in all ITS diverse forms of manifestation, as well as in the wholeness of life.

 

Nurturance of Life

Life, in this definition, is an individual’s sovereign reality. It is subjective and impressionable to the human instrument. Life is the wholeness of experience flowing past the individual’s field of perception in the dimension of nowness. There is never a closure to life or final chapter written. It is eternal, but not in the abstract sense of never ending or beginning, but rather in the real sense that life is ever expanding in order to express Source Intelligence in all fields of vibration within the Universe of Wholeness.

The nurturance of life is the principle that an individual is in alignment with the natural expansion of intelligence inherent within all life. This is an alignment that enhances the life-energy that flows past the individual with the clear intent of gentle support. It is the action of identifying the highest motive in all energy forms and supporting the flow of this energy towards its ultimate expression. In so doing, the action is performed without judgment, analysis, or attachment to outcome. It is simply nurturing the energy that flows from all manifestations and supporting its expression of life.

This is a departure from the normal perception that nurturing support can be granted only when energy is in alignment with personal will. However, when the individual can view life as an integrated energy flowing in the expression of expanding intelligence, life is honored as an extension of First Source. In this context, there is no energy that is misdirected or unworthy of support and nurturance. While this may seem contrary to the evidence of abusive energy upon terra-earth, even energy that is laden with “evil intent” is nevertheless energy that is flowing outward in search of a higher expression.

All forms of energy can be nurtured and supported to their highest expression, and this is the fundamental action of this principle. It requires the ability to perceive the causal motive and ultimate expression of life-energy as it passes through the individual’s sovereign reality. Energy is an element of life that is so subtly interwoven with form that it is one; in much the same manner as space and time are inextricably linked in union. Energy is a motive. It is intelligent beyond the mind’s ability to reason. While it is a force that can be subject to human applications that deny its highest expression, energy is always imbuing life with the motive to expand and evolve.

Life-energy is always in a state of becoming. It is never static or regressive in its natural state. The human instrument is very capable of nurturing this natural expansion of energy to forge new channels of expression and experience. In fact, it is the primary purpose of the human instrument to expand the life-energy that encircles its sovereign reality within physical existence and transform it to new levels of expression that more accurately reflect the perspective of the Sovereign Integral.

There are many specific actions that can be taken to nurture life. Each entity is, in a sense, programmed within its Source Codes to transmute energy through a tremendous variety of means. Working through the human instrument, the entity is able to collect and store energy within the human instrument and re-direct its purpose or application. The transmutation of energy can occur on either the personal or universal levels of expression. That is, within the sovereign reality of an individual, energy can be transmuted to conform to a vision of personal welfare, or aligned with a vision of universal welfare and goodwill.

One of the best methods to transmute energy is through one’s belief system. All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing chambers for the manifestation of the belief. Within these energy systems are currents that direct life experience. The human instrument is aware of these currents either consciously or unconsciously, and allows them to carry it into the realm of experience that exemplifies its true belief system.

By cultivating beliefs that expand and transform energy, the human instrument is able to engage energy systems that are nurturing to life in all its myriad forms. When beliefs are clearly defined as preferred states of being, the energy system is engaged in nowness—not in some future time. Now. The energy system becomes inseparable from the human instrument and woven into its spirit like a thread of light. Clarity of belief is essential to engaging the energy system of the belief, and allowing the nurturance of life to prevail in all activities.

So again, the nurturance of life is critical to both personal and universal realities within the Universe of Wholeness which contains all the fields of vibration that are interlinked like threads of an infinitely expanding fabric. Thus, as the individual awakens to their creative power to transmute energy and enhance it with the clear intent of gentle support, they become transmitters of Source Reality and architects of the synthesis model of existence.

Through the ongoing application of these life principles, Source Intelligence increasingly becomes the identity of the entity, and the entity becomes the identity of the human instrument. Thus, identity is transformed, and in the wake of this transformation, the Sovereign Integral unifies the human instrument with the entity, and the entity with Source Intelligence. It is this unification and shifts of identity that is the explicit purpose in expressing the life principles of the Sovereign Integral. If there is any other intention or objective these principles will remain misunderstood and their catalytic powers dormant.

It is the perspective of the Sovereign Integral that all life is pure love in its fullest expression, and that in this single concept, all life is conceived and forever exists. This becomes the core belief from which all other beliefs arise, and by their extension, one’s belief system emerges with a clear intent of supporting this fundamental perspective; of nurturing, observing, and appreciating the Universe of Wholeness as the cradle from which all life is created, evolves, and ultimately acknowledges.

These life principles are merely symbols represented in words and served to the human instrument as a potential recipe to stir awake the embers of light that tirelessly burn within. There are no specific techniques or rituals that are required to invoke the power of these principles. They are simply perspectives. In a real sense, they are intentions that attract experience that expand consciousness. They do not provide quick fixes or instant realizations. They are amplifiers of personal will and intention that clarify how one lives. Their transformative power is contained exclusively in the intent of their application.

Through these life principles of the Sovereign Integral, the individual can become a master of unlimiting the Self. Boundaries are set, veils are pulled down, and one’s light is subdued, simply because external, hierarchical controls create fear of the unknown and mystical practices of a sovereign being. In these life principles, if they are truly applied with proper intent, are the tools to accelerate the emergence of the Sovereign Integral and feel its perspective, its insights, and its empowered abilities to create new realities and shape them as learning adventures that liberate and expand consciousness. This is the underlying purpose of the principles and perhaps the best reason to explore them.

第一厅 - 主权整体的生命原则
实体表达模式旨在通过生物仪器探索新的振动领域，并通过这一发现过程转化为新的理解和表达水平，成为一个主权整体。主权整体是实体模式在时空宇宙中的最充分表达，最能体现源头智慧在其中的能力。这也是实体的自然存在状态，它已经超越了进化/奴隶制的存在模式，并通过完全激活其内嵌的源码而摆脱了等级制度的控制。这是第一源头最初设想的实体表达模式中 "种下 "的能力水平。时空宇宙中的所有实体都处于转型经验的不同阶段，随着它们的源码被完全激活，每个实体都注定要达到主权整体水平。
转变的经验是认识到实体的表达模式能够直接接触源泉智能信息，第一源泉的信息是在主权整体的实体层面上发现的。换句话说，人类工具，包括其生物、情感和心理能力，并不是实体源码的储存器。人类工具也不能伸出手来，收集这种解放的信息--这种光荣的自由，以获得一切。实体既是源码激活的港湾，也是获取源码的工具，通过人类工具和主权实体的整合，允许转化的经验显现出来。

转化的经验包括认识到，被感知的现实是以个人喜好的形式被人格化的源泉现实。因此，源泉现实和主权现实就像风和空气一样不可分割。这种融合只有通过转化的经验才能实现，它不同于时空宇宙中已知的任何东西。

地球上有一些人经历过这种强大风暴带来的浅浅的风。有些人称其为升天；其他人则将其命名为照明、视觉、启蒙、涅槃和宇宙意识。虽然这些体验以人类的标准来说是很深刻的，但它们只是主权整体的最初挑动，因为它越来越善于触及和唤醒其存在的遥远边缘。大多数物种定义为终极幸福的东西，只是主权整体对其形式的前哨低语的印象，并促使他们向内看，看他们存在的根源，并与这个无形和无边的智能结合，渗透到所有。

转化的经验远远超出了人类戏剧的校准，就像天上的星星超出了地球的触摸。你可以用人类的眼睛观察星星，但你永远不会用人类的手触摸它们。同样地，你可以用人类的工具朦胧地预见转化的经验，但你无法通过人类的工具体验它。它只能通过实体的整体性来获取，因为只有在整体性中，源码和它们对源现实感知的剩余影响才能存在。而实际上，这种整体性只有在个人意识从时间中分离出来，并能够在无时间性中看待自己的存在时才能获得。

然而，人类的工具在促进转变的经验方面是至关重要的，并使其引发类似于蜕变--将有形的身份整合到主权的整体之中。这是实体模型感知和表达的下一个阶段，当实体从象征源头现实的生命原则设计其现实时，它就被激活了，而不是被束缚在进化/奴隶制存在模式的外部来源的现实。

这些生命原则是源智能的创造模板。它们旨在从主权整体的角度创造现实，并在迄今为止排斥它的振动领域内加速其表现。它们是为实体的无形和有形身份的整合构建机会的原则。它们是人类工具--其所有组成部分完好无损--可以用来体验主权整体感知的桥梁。

随着人类工具对源头智能的反应越来越强烈，它将倾向于象征性地表达主要创造的形成原则的生命原则。有多种表达方式可以诱发主权整体的转变经验，并将实体从时间空间条件和外部控制中解放出来。由于表达方式的不同，表达的意图是相当狭义的，即扩展到一个整合的状态，使人类的工具越来越与主权整体的观点相一致。

有三个特别的生活原则可以加速转变的经验，并帮助人类工具与主权整体的观点相一致。它们是。

1）通过感恩建立宇宙关系

2) 在所有事情上遵守源头

3) 滋养生命

当个人应用这些原则时，他们的生活经历就会在其明显的随机事件中显示出更深的意义--无论是在普遍的还是个人的背景下。

 

通过感恩建立宇宙关系

这是一个原则，即整体性的宇宙代表一个集体智慧，可以被个性化为一个单一的普遍实体。因此，在这个推理模型中，整个宇宙中只有两个实体：个人实体和宇宙实体。由于个人是易受影响的，并不断变化以适应新的信息，所以宇宙实体也是如此，它是潜在能量和经验的动态和活的模板，是连贯的，就像一个朋友的个性和行为一样可知。

宇宙实体对个人及其感知和表达是有反应的。它就像一个综合的全能实体，被源头智慧所浸润，对个人的感知做出反应，就像一池水映照出笼罩它的图像。在人类工具中的每一个人，在其最内在的核心，确实是一个主权实体，可以将人类工具转变为主权整体的工具。然而，这种转变取决于个人是选择在宇宙实体的 "镜子 "上投射一个主权整体的形象，还是投射一个扭曲其真实状态的较差的形象。

通过感恩建立宇宙关系的原则主要涉及到通过欣赏宇宙实体的支持性 "镜子 "来有意识地设计自己的自我形象。换句话说，宇宙实体是在一个人的生活中塑造现实表达的伙伴。现实是一个内部的创造过程，如果个人在宇宙实体的镜子上投射出一个主权形象，就完全不受外部控制和条件的影响。

这个过程是一个从个人到宇宙实体的支持性能量的互换，这种能量最好是通过欣赏这种互换在生活的每一刻发生得多么完美和准确来应用。如果个人意识到（或至少有兴趣意识到）宇宙实体如何完美地支持个人的主权现实，那么一种强大而自然的感激之情就会从个人流向宇宙实体。正是这种感恩的泉源打开了从宇宙实体到个人的支持渠道，并建立了一个合作的目的，将人类工具转变为主权整体的表达。

主要是感恩，也就是对个人和宇宙实体的相互关系如何运作的欣赏，它打开了人类工具与主权实体的联系，最终转变为感知和表达的主权整体状态。个人与宇宙实体的关系是必须培养和培育的，因为它比其他任何东西都更能决定个人对生命的无数形式和表现的接受程度。

当个人接受主权现实的变化作为宇宙实体的变化角色时，他们与生命本身更加和谐。生命成为个人和宇宙实体之间的能量交换，允许其在没有判断的情况下进行，并毫无恐惧地体验。这就是无条件的爱的基本含义：体验生命的所有表现形式，作为一个单一的、统一的智能，对人类工具的投射图像作出完美的反应。

正是由于这个原因，当人类工具向宇宙实体投射感激之情时，无论环境或条件如何，生活会越来越支持人类工具开放，以激活其源码，并在综合表达模式的框架内生活。感激的感觉加上赞赏的心理概念，就像一个无形的信息一样，在所有方向和所有时间都被表达出来。在这个特定的背景下，对宇宙实体的感激之情是人类工具所渴望的所有表达形式背后的首要动机。

每一次呼吸、每一句话、每一次触摸、每一个想法、每一件事都以表达这种感恩之情为中心。一种感激之情，即个人拥有主权，并得到一个宇宙实体的支持，这个实体通过所有形式和表现的智慧来表达自己，其唯一目的是创造理想的现实，以激活个人的源码，并将人类的工具和实体转化为主权的整体。正是这种特殊形式的感恩，加速了源码的激活，以及它们整合人类工具和实体的不同组成部分的特殊能力，并将它们转变为主权整体的感知和表达状态。

时间是唯一的因素，它扭曲了个人和宇宙实体之间的这种原本清晰的联系。时间的介入，创造了绝望、无望和放弃的口袋。然而，正是这些 "口袋 "往往激活了实体的源码，并与宇宙实体建立了更亲密和和谐的关系。时间建立了经验的分离，以及对现实的不连续性的感知，这反过来又对宇宙实体的公平和总体目的系统产生了怀疑。结果造成恐惧，认为宇宙不是一面镜子，而是一种混乱的、异想天开的能量。

当人类的工具与主权整体保持一致，并从这个角度作为一个发展中的现实生活，它吸引了一个自然和谐的状态。这不一定意味着人类工具没有问题或不舒服，而是意味着一种感知，即生命所显示的东西有一个完整的目的。换句话说，自然和谐认为，生命体验的意义在于你与主权整体保持一致，你的个人现实必须来自多维宇宙的这一阶层，以创造持久的快乐和内在的和平。

感恩是爱的一个重要方面，它打开人类的工具，承认宇宙实体的作用，并重新定义其目的，作为主权现实的支持性延伸，而不是命运的异想天开或机械的、分离的宇宙的严格反应。通过感激之情的流露与宇宙实体建立关系，也吸引了具有变革性的生活经验。这些经验丰富地致力于揭示生命最深层的意义和最有形成力的目的。

 

观察万物之源

这是第一源头通过所有能量的表现形式存在于所有现实中的原则。它交织在所有事物中，就像一幅马赛克，其碎片附着在同一面墙上，因此是统一的。然而，统一马赛克的不是图片，而是它的碎片所附着的墙。同样，第一源泉描绘的图画是如此多样，显然不相关，似乎没有统一。然而，统一的不是外在的表现，而是内在的能量中心，在这个中心上，多样性的碎片被分层，统一了所有的表现。

这个能量中心是整体性宇宙中所有振动领域的所有生命的集体仓库。第一源泉通过其源泉智能投射到所有的生命片段中，将自己的一切形式潜移默化。因此，源泉智慧作为第一源泉的延伸，是统一的能量，是生命马赛克的所有碎片所依附的 "墙壁"。生命来自于一个能量源，它将所有的人与所有的人联系在一起，一个人与一个人联系在一起。

观察万物之源是这样一个原则：生命的所有表现都是第一源的表达。统一的能量被扭曲或歪曲到什么程度并不重要；可以观察到源头。它是一种感知能量统一的行动，即使外在表现看起来是随机的、扭曲的、不相关的或混乱的。

当生命的所有表现都被真正感知为第一源头的零散表达时，作为所有生命形式基础的平等振动就会被人类工具所感知。生命最初是作为源头现实的延伸而出现的，然后是作为一个独立的能量频率投入到一个形式中。它的振动，在其纯粹的、永恒的状态下，对所有生命的表现形式都是一样的。这是所有生命共享的共同点。这是所有生命形式中可以观察到的平等的音调振动，它将所有多样性的表达统一到被称为第一源的存在基础上。如果一个人能够以平等的眼光看待任何形式的生命，那么他们就是在观察万物之源。

虽然这似乎是一个抽象的概念，但它是通过寻找第一源的外在和内在表现的实践来实现的。在一个非常真实的意义上，个人期望在他们经验的每一个方面都能观察到源泉智能的运作。这是一种无可置疑的期望，即一切都在其应有的位置，发挥其最佳功能，并为其目的服务，以激活其生命在当下的最充分表达。它是一种展望，即所有的生命都处于一种最佳的实现和体验状态，无论条件或环境如何。它是这样一种看法：生命的表达是完美的，因为它来自完美，无论它的表现有多大的差异，生命都是源头现实的延伸。

鉴于伴随着地球上生命的明显动荡和明显的破坏，这种观点或看法似乎很天真。生命--包括其所有的形式和表现--怎么可能被视为最佳或完美？这是生命的巨大悖论，它无法与人类的精神或情感能力相协调。它只能在实体的背景下被理解，而实体是无死的、无限的、永恒的和主权的。悖论之所以存在，是因为人类的戏剧在范围和规模上过于有限，无法让整体性的感知介入并照亮拼图的各个部分是如何以完美的关系统一起来。

时间和空间的维度以及能量和物质的元素限制了人类的戏剧。由于等级制度控制信息和操纵条件的方法，它在生存和功能紊乱的阶段上上演。人类工具中的实体在人类戏剧中基本上没有得到表达和利用，因此，生活中明显的变态和不完美被孤立地视为完美的障碍，而不是完美本身。

生命是完美的，它决心扩大和表达一种无限的智慧。这是生命所有不同表现形式的基本目的，这是第一源头的存在--以平等的振动来表达自己--可以在所有事物中观察到。来自人类仪器的感觉输入被限制在特定范围内的频率，只能传达这种源泉振动的回声。真正的频率是通过对所有事物中固有的平等的深思熟虑来理解的，并且有能力超越事物的图画，渗透到图画的起源。

这些洞察力需要一个新的感官系统，超越在你们这个时代统治人类世界的五种感官。这些新的感官是源码激活的产物，代表了转化经验的第一阶段。有了这种新的感知能力，人类的工具将不仅能够感觉到第一源的存在，而且能够感觉到所有生命中的永恒本质，它是个性化的，与第一源独特的分离。

唤起人类工具内实体的感知是获得对源振动持久敏感的理想方法。这就是个人如何发展在所有事物中观察源的能力。第一源不仅在每个个体的能量表现中，而且也是生命本身的整体性。因此，这个原则要求在所有ITS的不同表现形式中观察源，以及在生命的整体性中观察源。

 

生命的滋养

在这个定义中，生命是一个人的主权现实。它是主观的，对人的工具来说是可印象的。生命是经验的整体性，它流经个人的感知领域，属于 "无 "的层面。生命永远没有结束，也没有最后一章的书写。它是永恒的，但不是抽象的意义上的永不结束或开始，而是在真实的意义上，生命在不断扩展，以便在整体性宇宙的所有振动领域中表达源头智慧。

生命的滋养是一个人与所有生命中固有的智慧的自然扩展保持一致的原则。这是一种对准，增强了流过个人的生命能量，具有温和支持的明确意图。它是识别所有能量形式中的最高动机并支持这种能量流向其最终表达的行动。在这样做的时候，这个行动是在没有判断、分析或对结果的依恋的情况下进行的。它只是培养从所有表现形式中流淌出来的能量，并支持它对生命的表达。

这与通常的看法不同，即只有当能量与个人意愿一致时，才能给予养育性支持。然而，当个人能够把生命看作是一种综合的能量，在不断扩展的智慧的表达中流动，生命就被尊为第一源的延伸。在这种情况下，没有任何能量被误导或不值得支持和滋养。虽然这似乎与地球上滥用能量的证据相悖，但即使是充满 "邪恶意图 "的能量，也是向外流动以寻求更高表达的能量。

所有形式的能量都可以被培养和支持到它们的最高表达，这就是这个原则的基本行动。它要求有能力感知生命能量的因果动机和最终表达，因为它通过了个人的主权现实。能量是生命的一个元素，它与形式巧妙地交织在一起，成为一体；就像空间和时间不可分割地结合在一起一样。能量是一种动机。它的智慧超出了大脑的推理能力。虽然它是一种可能受制于人的应用而否定其最高表达的力量，但能量总是给生命注入扩张和进化的动机。

生命能量总是处于一种成为的状态。在其自然状态下，它从来不是静止的或倒退的。人类工具非常有能力培育这种能量的自然扩展，以形成新的表达和体验渠道。事实上，人类工具的主要目的是扩大生命能量，将其包围在物理存在的主权现实中，并将其转化为新的表达水平，更准确地反映主权整体的观点。

有许多具体的行动可以用来培育生命。从某种意义上说，每个实体都在其源码中被编程，通过各种巨大的手段来转化能量。通过人类工具工作，实体能够在人类工具内收集和储存能量，并重新引导其目的或应用。能量的转化可以发生在个人或宇宙的表达层面。也就是说，在个人的主权现实中，能量可以被转化为符合个人福利的愿景，或与普遍福利和善意的愿景保持一致。

转化能量的最好方法之一是通过一个人的信仰系统。所有的信仰都有能量系统，这些能量系统就像信仰表现的孕育室。在这些能量系统中，有引导生命体验的电流。人类工具有意识或无意识地意识到这些气流，并允许它们把它带入体现其真正信仰体系的经验领域。

通过培养扩展和转化能量的信念，人类的工具能够参与到能量系统中去，从而培育出各种形式的生命。当信念被清楚地定义为首选的存在状态时，能量系统就会参与其中，而不是在未来的某个时间。现在。能量系统与人的工具密不可分，像光的线一样交织在人的精神里。信念的明确性对参与信仰的能量系统至关重要，并使生命的滋养在所有活动中占上风。

因此，在包含所有振动领域的整体性宇宙中，生命的滋养对个人和普遍的现实都至关重要，这些振动领域就像无限扩展的织物的线一样相互联系。因此，当个人觉醒到他们转换能量的创造能力，并以温和支持的明确意图增强能量时，他们就成为源泉现实的传播者和存在的综合模式的设计师。

通过对这些生命原则的持续应用，源智能越来越成为实体的身份，而实体则成为人类工具的身份。因此，身份被改变了，在这种转变之后，主权整体将人类工具与实体统一起来，实体与源泉智能统一起来。正是这种身份的统一和转变，才是表达主权整体的生命原则的明确目的。如果有任何其他的意图或目标，这些原则将继续被误解，其催化力量将处于休眠状态。

主权整体的观点是，所有的生命都是最充分表达的纯爱，在这个单一的概念中，所有的生命都被孕育并永远存在。这成为所有其他信仰产生的核心信念，通过它们的延伸，一个人的信仰系统出现了，其明确的意图是支持这一基本观点；培育、观察和欣赏整体性的宇宙，作为所有生命被创造、演变和最终承认的摇篮。

这些生命原则只是用文字表示的符号，作为潜在的配方提供给人类工具，以搅动唤醒内在不知疲倦地燃烧的光烬。要调用这些原则的力量，不需要具体的技术或仪式。它们只是一种观点。在真正的意义上，它们是吸引扩展意识的经验的意图。它们不提供快速修复或即时实现。它们是个人意志和意图的放大器，阐明了一个人的生活方式。它们的变革力量完全包含在其应用的意图中。

通过这些主权整体的生活原则，个人可以成为解除自我限制的主人。界限被设定，面纱被拉下，一个人的光芒被压制，仅仅是因为外部的、等级的控制造成了对未知的恐惧和主权者的神秘实践。在这些生命原则中，如果真正以正确的意图来应用，就是加速主权整体的出现的工具，感受它的视角、它的洞察力和它被授权的能力，创造新的现实，并将它们塑造为解放和扩展意识的学习冒险。这就是这些原则的根本目的，也许也是探索这些原则的最好理由。
