Chamber Three – The Blueprint of Exploration
First Source created a blueprint of exploration to redefine itself and beget purpose to the multiverse and all existence therein. The purpose of this system is to explore the worlds of creation and evolve the ability of the individuated consciousness to acquire and express wisdom. Each individuated consciousness is a fragment of the beautiful mosaic that depicts the personage of First Source. The blueprint of exploration organizes these disparate fragments and adjoins them in their proper place to restore the wholeness of First Source—reconfigured to achieve the creation, inhabitation, and transformation of yet another universe.
Throughout the cosmos there is life—the expression of First Source in individuated form. These are the divine fragments that are always in the process of separating to experience individual expression of self, and congealing to experience universal expression of First Source. We are born from the very womb of the cosmos, and it is here that all will return in time. It matters not when or how. It only matters why.

The distance of this womb from your earth is near infinite, and yet, so close that it would make your heart quiver if you knew the reach of your imagination. In the very beginning of your existence, as a formless consciousness, you chose to experience individual expression and separate from your Source. And when you chose the three-dimensional world as your platform of experience, you embarked into the world of time in which you would encounter every conceivable obstacle and challenge to your restoration of oneness with your Creator.

This blueprint of exploration is the underlying foundation of the cosmos and it consists of five basic stages of experience as it relates to the individual consciousness.

 

I. The Creation of the Entity Consciousness.

From out of the spirit-essence of Source Intelligence, flowing from First Source, each of you is born. As particles of light leavened by Source Intelligence to arise and secure individual consciousness, you are born an immortal entity that shares the essence of First Source in non-time and non-space. This is the Entity consciousness that is imbued with the Wholeness Navigator that permits the Entity to separate from First Source into individuality, but remain guided by Source Intelligence.

The entity is the highest state of consciousness, dwelling in a state of total awareness of all lesser instruments or bodies, which feed it experience and insight. The entity consciousness is the infallible observer of experience and synthesizer of insight. In all respects, it is a miniature of First Source, lacking only the experiential relationship with time and space that develops its sense of empowerment to act independently of First Source.

It is precisely this sense of independence that the birth of the entity begets. It is the central part of the blueprint of exploration because without this sense of independence, exploration of the cosmos and its various fields of vibration would be limited to the perception of First Source, peering through the lens of Source Intelligence. By definition it is a single dimensional perception, and therefore, an incomplete exploration. First Source decreed this exploration as a result of its creation of the multiverse, and when it was created, First Source summoned itself in the form of light particles and cast these particles into separation.

The first of these creations was bestowed an individual identity through the use of a physical instrument known as a light body. The density of this body was sufficient to block the separated particles from First Source’s dominant reality. In doing so, the particles became autonomous explorers and quickly populated the innermost realms of the Universe of Wholeness. However, they never ventured into the outer realms of creation where the density of vibration decelerated time to such an extent that exploration in bodies was impossible, owing to the great distance.

These initial entities understood that their existence held a very specific purpose, which was to construct a vehicle for the newly created entity consciousness to inhabit so the individuated spirit-form could enter the most remote sections of the multiverse and explore, experience, and learn from them. This would be similar to constructing a deep-sea diving suit that permits a diver to explore the sea bottom. First Source, working through Source Intelligence, could perceive the outermost realms of creation, but it was unable to experience them and, therefore, acquire wisdom about the very things First Source created.

WingMakers were the first creations that housed the entity consciousness. We are the architects and designers of the human instrument in all its various forms throughout the multiverse. The human species is not unique in the multiverse. There are many variations on other planets within your known universe. Nearly all of you have experience in these other realms of the universe, but you are not able to translate these experiences to your conscious mind. Even so, as First Source birthed the entity consciousness, the WingMakers created the instruments of exploration that enabled this newly formed consciousness to explore the dense vibratory realms of the outermost creation.

Because the vibratory rate of the physical universe is decelerated to such an extent that particles solidify into clusters of objects, time decelerates into sequential frames of perception, allowing the entity consciousness to explore multiple worlds simultaneously. This enables one entity to explore hundreds, if not thousands, of worlds in a single frame of time. This creates the perception—albeit dimly felt by most of you—that you have lived before and that you will live again.

In reality, if you are within a human instrument, you are an immortal light consciousness gathered from the same substance as First Source. You were born of this substance, and you will never die from it. It is not possible to discard or revoke this most pure of vibrations that is your core identity. Deep inside of you there is no doubt of this truth. There is only the question of why you were individuated.

 

The Individual of Time and Genetic Density

The entity is driven by its very nature to explore creation. This is the core identity of First Source, and it was bestowed upon all of its creations like a genetic trait is passed from a parent to its child. This primal instinct instructs the entity to submerge into the realms of creation for the purposes of exploration, without the attendant anticipation of achievement or conquest.

This form of exploration is not simply to discover new geographies or physical states of existence. More importantly, it is to discover new emotional states of perception that enhances the collective wisdom of First Source. Exploration begets wisdom. This is the practical perspective of the entity consciousness, and it is precisely this innate quality that compels the entity to descend into time and density.

The entity consciousness is aware of its connection to First Source through Source Intelligence. It is also aware of the opportunity to take its pure-state vibration into other dimensions of time and space through the instruments that have been created by the WingMakers. Through these instruments, or bodies, as you might think of them, the entity can explore decelerated vibratory states like your planet.

When the entity takes on the light body, it is still essentially formless. Its identity, while separate from First Source, is not separate from other entities within the light body. Thus, it is not yet cast into individuality. This stage occurs only when the light body moves into an instrument of genetic density. What your scientists call DNA is the instrument created by the WingMakers that permits the light body to explore the multiverse and acquire the individuated state of separation from First Source and its particles of light consciousness that we call the entity.

 

The Blueprint of Exploration

The vast conditions of creaturehood beckon the light body to don an instrument and follow its instincts to explore. The moment this is done, the entity becomes aware of itself as an individual. However, this individuality is not overwhelming, nor is it feared. It is simply a new sense of independence; the microcosm of self-learning begins to bloom.

Contrary to your religious instructions, there is no accompanying punishment that follows the state of independence. The entity is not punished for its choice of explorations, otherwise the state of independence would be impossible to achieve. It is only through this state of independence or freewill that the entity can achieve a unique perspective. If the boundaries were prescribed too narrowly, and the entity was punished or allowed to accumulate sin each time it strayed, it would become more of an automaton than an explorer.

Without authentic exploration within the worlds of creation, the value of the experience for both the entity and First Source is greatly diminished. Just as a newborn human expresses its energy in the awkward movements of its limbs, the new entity expresses its energy in the awkward decisions of its exploratory path. These decisions include every conceivable movement into darkness that can be imagined, and it is because of this that the entity develops its uniqueness.

 

The Acquisition of Experience through Separation

When the entity becomes unique, it can acquire experience and insight that is unique. And this is the precious cargo that the entity was designed to transmit to First Source. Individuality and independence were the gifts bestowed to the entity, and unique insight was the gift returned. This is how the multiverse is designed, and the blueprint of exploration is indifferent to the nature of the instrument, its outward appearance, its usefulness to a given species, or its contributions to the world from which it was born. The only objective worth expressing is that the entity secured for itself, and provided to First Source, a unique perspective during its sojourn into time and genetic density.

When the entity functions within a human instrument it remains attuned to First Source, but the mind learns to identify with its instrument of exploration, and seldom achieves a sustainable impression of the entity’s pure-state vibration. However, this vibration is always remembered by the entity consciousness and expressed within the three-dimensional realm through the sense of equality and shared purpose that all entities possess.

The human instrument, when it is donned by the entity, becomes a dominant reality in which the entity’s observational stage is cast. It is very similar to a pilot who enters a plane and begins to fixate on the control panels. The entity can operate effectively within a wide range of one to approximately one thousand dominant realities—each occurring in sequential time simultaneously. As a consequence, the entity is able to both accelerate and balance its learning across a broad range of experiential platforms.

We understand that the concept of simultaneous experiential learning platforms is a concept that pulls against every three-dimensional fiber in your bodies and minds, but it is the true way in which you were designed. WingMakers have produced not less than one hundred thousand variations of the human instrument—all structured around the same DNA template and each scattered across the seven physical universes of our multiverse. When you read these words, you are operating in tens, if not hundreds, of simultaneous realities throughout the multiverse, but only the entity is able to perceive these realities.

When the entity moves into independence, it initially operates in one dominant reality and gradually becomes adept at processing multiple data streams from multiple instruments. Remember that the entity is first and foremost within a light body, and that this light body is without structure, as you know it. It is both a point fixed in time and space, and a consciousness that is omnipresent. The human instrument was designed to have an aperture that focuses this omnipresent consciousness into multiple channels of perception, but at the same time limit the perception of the human instrument to one dominant reality.

This was done by necessity because the mind, emotions, and body cannot withstand the aggregate experience of multiple instruments. It overloads the system and causes the human instrument to break down and ultimately collapse. It also makes the delicate connection between the entity awareness and the mind and emotions more clouded. Even with this accounted for, the subconscious realms enable these currents of simultaneity to disperse and provide a cleansing space for the mind and emotions.

The entity is like a beam of white light, and as it passes into the genetic density of the human instrument, it separates into a broad spectrum of experience. Owing to the genetic structures into which the entity’s light energy passes, it accumulates unique perspective that is shaped into an emotional wisdom that can be transmitted to First Source and to the species at large.

 

The Ascending Spiral to the True Wisdom

The entity’s sojourns within the physical realms of the multiverse are vast as measured by time and space. They comprise, in most cases, an aggregate of tens of thousands of years, and each of these years produce an effect on the entity. These messages of time shape them into new forms. And these forms emerge as exemplars of what is to be in the distant future. These are the Sovereign Integrals spoken of in our previous discourses.

These beings are able to look upon their experience in all forms, places, and time, and integrate the total experience into an expression that is imported to the human species. It is the pinnacle of testimony, and it seldom occurs in a species until it has defined its true wisdom.

You rightfully claim wisdom in your religious books, scientific journals, and philosophical discourses, but this is not your true wisdom as it pertains to your species. The difference is simple; your true wisdom will not divide your species. It will unite it. And it will not be unification through love and emotions; it will be through a shared connection to the rightful meaning of the multiverse because this is the only lens that, when focused, resolves your place as a species.

Are we saying that science will lead you to this true wisdom? No, we are telling you that there will be a handful of your species that will step forward as Sovereign Integrals with a balanced scientific and philosophical nature, and they will have the benefit of an educated species that will listen to the inconvertible evidence.

Even First Source cannot bring a species to its true wisdom. The leaders of the species must achieve it through organic, self-inventive methods. First Source, through its original blueprint of exploration, enabled the humanoid species the ability and means to acquire this knowledge itself. If the true wisdom were brought to the species from outside itself, it would be inherently mistrusted and it would not be sufficiently compelling to unite the species.

There are numerous revelations that have been brought to your species through non-physical entities in the form of what you term, channeled information. Even parts of your Holy books are channeled. However, these writings were for the few. They did not contain the true wisdom—they only hinted at the shadow it casts. The Sovereign Integrals will emerge like beacons for your species, and elevate the mental and emotional perceptions of the entire species.

When one Sovereign Integral emerges, it will, by the catalytic forces of its own entity consciousness, cause another to arise, and another, and another, and it will cascade from one to one thousand in a single generation. From this one thousand, will arise one million in the next generation, and from this one million the entire population will arise, imbued with this insight gained from the portal into the multiverse. And from this portal will arise the organization of the true wisdom into a form that will endure against all attacks.

This is the grand unification of the species around the new, non-hierarchical structures that enable the experience of the true wisdom to the newborn of its species in order to perpetuate the unification of the species. Within six generations, the genetic mind of the species is stable and then becomes a powerful tool of exploration that the species will come to understand as its “spaceship” into the multiverse.

The human species of your planet will become the teachers who channel the shadowy outline of the true wisdom to a new species that is, even now, unconsciously awaiting your arrival. The process is carried out over and over, always with variations and anomalies that spark deeper insights and pathways into the Central Universe from which First Source has its being. It is the most powerful of all gravity fields, and ultimately leads a species and its individuated entities to its periphery from which we, the WingMakers, reside as your future selves.

 

The Onward Journey of Developing Creation

The entity is viewed in the universe of time and space as an evolving particle of exploration commissioned by First Source to explore, populate, develop, and transform the outposts of creations into enclaves of Source Intelligence. When the entity is viewed in the dimensions of non-time and non-space—its natural habitat—it appears as an immortal facet of First Source that has been individuated, but when viewed in the three-dimensional environment of genetic density, it appears as a temporal facet of its species.

The species—in this case, the human species—evolves in time as the elder race that guides a developing race in the formation of its metaphysical and scientific foundations. They become the culture-builders of a new species. The evolution of a species stretches from its origins in the Central Universe as a unified genetic model fit to explore the multiverse, to a fragmentation of the species into biologic diversity, to its re-unification through culture and technology, to its ascension as a non-physical unified Genetic Mind, to its application of this Genetic Mind as a means to explore the outer reaches of the cosmos and help guide a developing species, and to the merging of this Genetic Mind with the Genetic Mind of its ancestral race.

Your scientists have defined the evolution of the species on a scale that is only the equivalent of a tiny splinter of wood in a vast forest of time and space. The evolution of the human species through the “forest” of time and space is an exceedingly dense process, consisting of innumerable levels of progress that ultimately enables the Genetic Mind of the species to blend harmoniously with First Source.

What fuels this process is the genetically endowed drive of the entity to explore the worlds of creation, and to ultimately acquire the necessary wisdom and compassion to lead a younger species to its true wisdom. You may wonder why this process seems so convoluted and fraught with missteps and mistakes. We tell you that the process is not what it seems. The Genetic Mind of the elder race that is working with your species on terra-earth operates in a window of time more comprehensive and inclusive than you can imagine.

The gateway into your future is through the completion of this blueprint, and this blueprint is encoded deep within your species. At your root, you are not an immortal psychic impression, or mental echo, but rather, you are the faultless triune of First Source, Source Intelligence and the sovereign entity, colliding in a dance of energy that is evermore. Your mind must grasp the fullness of your true nature and depth of your being, or you will fall prey to the psychic impression and mental echo of your lesser self.

If you believe, as you are taught, in the lesser self, you will reach for the food that nourishes the shadow and not the substance. The substance of your design is awakened with the words that form the concepts of your enlarged self-image. And these words are not merely spoken, but they are seen, felt, and heard as well. They lead you to the tone of equality and the perception of wholeness. Allow these words to wash over you like a gentle wave that brings you buoyancy and movement. It will sweep you to a new shore, and it is there that you will begin to uncover your true nature and purpose.

The blueprint of exploration is the genetic substrate of your design, and all the so-called “lower” life forms are the “limbs” of your species. Without them, you could not exist. And so the composite life form is truly the species of which we speak when we speak of the human species. We do not separate you from the plant and animal kingdoms. We see them as one composite species. It is your scientists who have chosen to separate the one species into billions of sub-species because wholeness cannot be classified and analyzed.

The tools of the mind suppress the true nature of your species. Only when you observe with the frequency of equality foremost in your heart and mind, can you bypass this suppression and feel the linkages that organize your species into a master organism. It is this organism that is in perfect alignment with First Source like two circles that overlap so perfectly that only one is seen. It is the very nature of First Source to create innumerable fragments of itself and lead each to cohesion as a master organism, while allowing each fragment to retain its sovereignty. This is the perfect bestowal of love.

While First Source cannot be found through searching, if you will submit to the leading impulse of the sovereign entity within you, you will unerringly be guided, step by step, life after life, through universe upon universe, and age by age, until you finally peer into the eyes of your Creator and realize you are one. And in this realization you will see that the species from which you emerge is one also. The fragments of the one congeal through the blueprint of exploration whose end is not foreseen, and whose beginning is not measured by time.

第三厅--探索的蓝图
第一源头创造了一个探索的蓝图，以重新定义自己，并为多元宇宙和其中的所有存在带来目的。这个系统的目的是探索创造的世界，发展个体意识获得和表达智慧的能力。每个独立的意识都是描绘第一源头人物的美丽马赛克的一个片段。探索的蓝图将这些不相干的碎片组织起来，并将它们连接到适当的位置，以恢复第一源的整体性--重新配置以实现另一个宇宙的创造、居住和改造。
在整个宇宙中，存在着生命--第一源泉以个体形式的表达。这些是神圣的碎片，它们总是在分离的过程中体验自我的个体表达，并凝结成第一源的普遍表达。我们从宇宙的子宫中诞生，所有的人都会及时回到这里。何时或如何返回并不重要。唯一重要的是为什么。

这个子宫与你们地球的距离几乎是无限的，然而，如果你们知道你们的想象力有多大，它将使你们的心颤抖。在你们存在的最初阶段，作为一个无形的意识，你们选择了体验个体的表达，并与你们的源头分离。当你选择三维世界作为你的经验平台时，你踏入了时间的世界，在这个世界里，你会遇到每一个可以想象的障碍和挑战，以恢复你与你的创造者的一体性。

这个探索的蓝图是宇宙的根本基础，它由五个基本的经验阶段组成，因为它与个人意识有关。

 

I.实体意识的创造。

从源头智能的精神本质中，从第一源头流出来，你们每个人都诞生了。作为被源头智慧激发的光粒子，你们诞生了一个不朽的实体，在非时间和非空间中分享第一源的本质。这就是实体的意识，它被注入了整体性导航器，允许实体从第一源头分离出来成为个体，但仍由源头智能引导。

实体是意识的最高境界，居住在对所有较小的工具或身体的完全意识状态中，这些工具或身体为它提供经验和洞察力。实体意识是经验的无懈可击的观察者和洞察力的综合者。在所有方面，它都是第一源泉的缩影，只是缺乏与时间和空间的经验关系，而这种关系发展了它独立于第一源泉行事的权力感。

实体的诞生正是产生了这种独立意识。它是探索蓝图的核心部分，因为如果没有这种独立意识，对宇宙及其各种振动领域的探索将仅限于对第一源的感知，通过源智能的镜头来观察。根据定义，这是一个单一维度的感知，因此是一个不完整的探索。第一源头下令进行这种探索，作为它创造多元宇宙的结果，当它被创造时，第一源头以光粒子的形式召唤自己，并将这些粒子投向分离。

这些创造物中的第一个通过使用被称为光体的物理工具被赋予了个人身份。这个身体的密度足以将分离的粒子与第一源的主导现实阻隔。这样一来，这些粒子就成了自主的探索者，并迅速占领了整体性宇宙的最内部领域。然而，他们从来没有冒险进入创造的外部领域，那里的振动密度使时间减速到如此程度，由于距离太远，用身体探索是不可能的。

这些最初的实体明白，他们的存在有一个非常具体的目的，那就是为新创造的实体意识构建一个载体，让其居住在其中，以便独立的精神形态能够进入多元宇宙的最偏远部分，并探索、体验和学习。这类似于建造一件深海潜水服，允许潜水员探索海底。第一源头通过源头智能工作，可以感知创造的最外层领域，但它无法体验它们，因此，无法获得关于第一源头所创造的事物的智慧。

造翼者是第一批容纳实体意识的创造物。我们是整个多元宇宙中各种形式的人类工具的建筑师和设计师。人类物种在多元宇宙中并非独一无二。在你们已知的宇宙中的其他星球上有许多变种。你们几乎都有在宇宙其他领域的经验，但你们无法将这些经验转化为你们的意识。即便如此，随着第一源头孕育了实体意识，造翼者创造了探索的工具，使这个新形成的意识能够探索最外层创造的密集振动领域。

因为物理宇宙的振动率被减速到如此程度，以至于粒子凝固成物体的集群，时间被减速成连续的感知框架，允许实体意识同时探索多个世界。这使一个实体能够在一个时间框架内探索数百个，甚至数千个世界。这创造了一种感知--尽管你们中的大多数人都朦胧地感觉到--你们曾经生活过，你们将再次生活。

在现实中，如果你在一个人的工具中，你是一个不朽的光意识，从第一源头的相同物质中聚集而成。你从这种物质中诞生，你将永远不会从它中死亡。不可能抛弃或撤销这种最纯净的振动，这是你们的核心身份。在你的内心深处，对这一真理没有任何怀疑。只有一个问题，那就是为什么你会被分化。

 

时间和遗传密度的个体

该实体被其本质所驱使去探索创造。这是第一源泉的核心身份，它被赋予了所有的创造物，就像父母传给孩子的遗传特征一样。这种原始的本能指示实体为了探索的目的而潜入创造的领域，而没有随之而来的对成就或征服的期待。

这种形式的探索不仅仅是为了发现新的地理或物理存在状态。更重要的是，它是为了发现新的情感感知状态，以增强第一源的集体智慧。探索产生了智慧。这是实体意识的实际观点，也正是这种先天的品质，迫使实体下降到时间和密度。

实体意识意识到它通过源智能与第一源的联系。它也意识到有机会通过造翼者所创造的工具，将其纯态振动带入其他时间和空间维度。通过这些工具，或身体，正如你可能认为的那样，实体可以探索像你的星球那样的减速振动状态。

当实体带上光体时，它本质上仍然是无形的。它的身份虽然与第一源分离，但与光体中的其他实体并不分离。因此，它还没有被铸成个体性。这个阶段只有在光体进入遗传密度的工具时才会发生。你们的科学家所称的DNA是造翼者所创造的工具，它允许光体探索多元宇宙，并获得与第一源和它的光意识粒子分离的个体化状态，我们称之为实体。

 

探索的蓝图

生物性的广阔条件召唤着光体穿上工具，跟随其本能去探索。这样做的时候，实体就意识到自己是一个个体。然而，这种个体性不是压倒性的，也不是害怕的。它只是一种新的独立感；自我学习的微观世界开始绽放。

与你们的宗教指示相反，独立状态之后并没有伴随着惩罚。实体不会因为其探索的选择而受到惩罚，否则独立状态就不可能实现。只有通过这种独立或自由意志的状态，实体才能实现独特的视角。如果界限规定得太窄，实体每次偏离都会受到惩罚或被允许积累罪孽，那么它就会成为一个自动机而不是一个探索者。

如果没有在创造的世界中进行真实的探索，实体和第一源泉的经验价值就会大大降低。就像一个新生儿在其四肢的笨拙动作中表达其能量一样，新实体在其探索道路的笨拙决定中表达其能量。这些决定包括所有可以想象到的进入黑暗的运动，正是因为如此，实体才发展出它的独特性。

 

通过分离获得经验

当实体变得独特时，它可以获得独特的经验和洞察力。而这正是实体被设计来传送给第一源的珍贵货物。个性和独立是赐予实体的礼物，而独特的洞察力是回报的礼物。多元宇宙就是这样设计的，探索的蓝图对仪器的性质、它的外貌、它对特定物种的有用性，或它对它所诞生的世界的贡献都无动于衷。唯一值得表达的目标是，该实体在进入时间和遗传密度的旅程中，为自己确保了一个独特的视角，并提供给第一源。

当实体在人类的工具中运作时，它仍然与第一源头保持一致，但头脑学会了认同它的探索工具，很少能达到实体的纯态振动的持续印象。然而，这种振动总是被实体的意识所记住，并通过所有实体所拥有的平等感和共同目的在三维领域内表达出来。

人类的工具，当它被实体穿上时，成为一个主导的现实，实体的观察舞台就在其中。这非常类似于一个进入飞机的飞行员，开始固定在控制面板上。实体可以在一个到大约一千个主导现实的广泛范围内有效运作--每一个都是在连续的时间内同时发生的。因此，该实体能够在广泛的经验平台上加速和平衡其学习。

我们知道，同时体验学习平台的概念是一个与你们身体和头脑中的每一根三维纤维相抵触的概念，但这是你们被设计的真正方式。造翼者已经产生了不少于十万个人类工具的变体--所有的结构都围绕着相同的DNA模板，每个都散布在我们多元宇宙的七个物理宇宙中。当你阅读这些文字时，你是在整个多元宇宙的数十个，甚至数百个同时存在的现实中运作，但只有实体能够感知这些现实。

当实体进入独立状态时，它最初在一个主导的现实中运作，逐渐变得善于处理来自多个仪器的多个数据流。请记住，实体首先是在一个光体中，而且这个光体没有结构，正如你所知道的那样。它既是一个固定在时间和空间的点，又是一个无所不在的意识。人类的仪器被设计成有一个光圈，把这个无所不在的意识集中到多个感知渠道，但同时又把人类仪器的感知限制在一个主导的现实中。

这是不得已而为之，因为思想、情感和身体无法承受多种工具的综合经验。它使系统超载，导致人类的工具崩溃，最终崩溃。它还使实体意识与头脑和情感之间的微妙联系更加模糊。即使考虑到这一点，潜意识领域也能使这些同时性的气流消散，为心灵和情感提供一个清洁的空间。

实体就像一束白光，当它进入人类工具的遗传密度时，它分离成一个广泛的经验光谱。由于实体的光能所进入的遗传结构，它积累了独特的视角，被塑造成一种情感智慧，可以传递给第一源和整个物种。

 

通往真正智慧的螺旋式上升

以时间和空间来衡量，实体在多元宇宙的物理领域内的游历是巨大的。在大多数情况下，它们包括数万年的总和，而这些年的每一年都对实体产生影响。这些时间的信息将它们塑造为新的形式。而这些形式作为遥远的未来的典范而出现。这些是我们以前的论述中提到的主权综合体。

这些生命能够审视他们在所有形式、地点和时间的经验，并将全部经验整合成一种表达，输入到人类物种中。这是见证的巅峰，在一个物种确定其真正的智慧之前，它很少发生。

你们在你们的宗教书籍、科学杂志和哲学论述中理所当然地声称有智慧，但这不是你们真正的智慧，因为它与你们的物种有关。区别很简单；你们的真正智慧不会分裂你们的物种。它将使它团结起来。而且它不会是通过爱和情感的统一；它将是通过与多元宇宙的正确意义的共同联系，因为这是唯一的镜头，当聚焦时，解决了你们作为一个物种的位置。

我们是说，科学将引导你们找到这种真正的智慧吗？不，我们是在告诉你们，你们中会有少数人作为具有平衡的科学和哲学性质的主权综合体站出来，他们会有一个受过教育的物种的好处，会倾听不可逆转的证据。

即使是第一源泉也不能使一个物种达到其真正的智慧。该物种的领导人必须通过有机的、自我发明的方法来实现它。第一源泉，通过其最初的探索蓝图，使类人种有能力和手段自己获得这种知识。如果真正的智慧是从外部带给这个物种的，那么它就会被固有的不信任，它就不会有足够的说服力来团结这个物种。

有许多启示是通过非物理实体以你们所说的通道信息的形式带给你们人类的。甚至你们的圣书中的部分内容也是被引导的。然而，这些著作是为少数人写的。他们并不包含真正的智慧--他们只是暗示了它所投下的阴影。主权综合体将像你们物种的灯塔一样出现，并提升整个物种的精神和情感认知。

当一个主权整体出现时，它将通过其自身实体意识的催化力量，导致另一个出现，另一个，再另一个，它将在一个世代中从一到一千层层叠叠。从这一千人中，将在下一代产生一百万人，而从这一百万人中，整个人口将产生，被从进入多元宇宙的门户中获得的这种洞察力所感染。从这个门户中，真正的智慧将被组织起来，形成一种能抵御所有攻击的形式。

这是物种的大统一，围绕着新的、无等级的结构，使其物种的新生儿能够体验到真正的智慧，以延续物种的统一。在六代之内，该物种的遗传思维是稳定的，然后成为一个强大的探索工具，该物种将理解为其进入多元宇宙的 "宇宙飞船"。

你们星球上的人类将成为教师，将真正智慧的朦胧轮廓传递给一个新的物种，甚至现在就在无意识地等待你们的到来。这个过程反复进行，总是有变化和异常，引发更深的洞察力和进入中央宇宙的途径，第一源泉就来自于此。它是所有引力场中最强大的，并最终将一个物种和它的个体实体引向它的外围，我们，造翼者，作为你们未来的自我居住在那里。

 

发展创造的前进之路

在时间和空间的宇宙中，实体被视为第一源委托的一个不断发展的探索粒子，以探索、填充、发展，并将创造物的前哨转化为源智能的飞地。当实体在非时间和非空间的维度--它的自然栖息地--被视为第一源的一个不朽的面，它已被独立出来，但当在遗传密度的三维环境中被视为其物种的一个时间面。

物种--在这种情况下，人类物种--在时间上演变为年长的种族，指导发展中的种族形成其形而上学和科学的基础。他们成为一个新物种的文化建设者。一个物种的进化从它在中央宇宙的起源，作为一个适合探索多元宇宙的统一基因模型，到物种分裂成生物多样性，到通过文化和技术重新统一，到它作为一个非物理的统一基因思维的提升，到它应用这个基因思维作为探索宇宙外部的手段，帮助指导一个发展中的物种，到这个基因思维与它祖先种族的基因思维合并。

你们的科学家把物种的进化定义在一个规模上，而这个规模只相当于广阔的时间和空间森林中的一个小木片。人类物种通过时间和空间的 "森林 "的进化是一个极其密集的过程，由无数层次的进步组成，最终使物种的遗传心智与第一源头和谐地融合。

推动这一过程的是实体在基因上被赋予的动力，即探索创造的世界，并最终获得必要的智慧和同情心，带领年轻的物种获得真正的智慧。你可能想知道为什么这个过程看起来如此曲折，充满了错误和失误。我们告诉你，这个过程并不像它看起来那样。正在地球上与你们的物种合作的长老种族的遗传思想，其运作的时间窗口比你们所能想象的要全面和包容。

进入你的未来的途径是通过完成这个蓝图，而这个蓝图是在你的物种深处编码的。在你的根部，你不是一个不朽的精神印象，或精神回声，而是第一源头、源头智慧和主权实体的无懈可击的三位一体，在一个能量的舞蹈中碰撞，是永远的。你的头脑必须掌握你真实本性的充实和你存在的深度，否则你将沦为你较小的自我的精神印象和精神回声的猎物。

如果你相信，就像你被教导的那样，相信较小的自我，你就会去找滋养阴影的食物，而不是实质。你设计的实质是通过形成你扩大的自我形象概念的话语来唤醒的。这些话语不仅仅是说出来的，而且还能看到、感觉到和听到。它们把你引向平等的基调和对整体性的感知。让这些话语像温柔的波浪一样冲过你，给你带来浮力和运动。它将把你卷到一个新的岸边，在那里你将开始发现你的真实本性和目的。

探索的蓝图是你们设计的遗传基质，所有所谓的 "低等 "生命形式是你们物种的 "四肢"。没有它们，你们就不可能存在。因此，当我们谈到人类时，复合生命形式确实是我们谈到的物种。我们不把你们与植物和动物王国分开。我们把它们看作是一个复合物种。是你们的科学家选择把一个物种分成几十亿个亚种，因为整体性是不能被分类和分析的。

心灵的工具压制了你们物种的真实性质。只有当你以平等的频率观察你的心和思想时，你才能绕过这种压制，感受到将你的物种组织成一个主有机体的联系。正是这个有机体与第一源头完美地结合在一起，就像两个圆圈如此完美地重叠在一起，只有一个被看到。第一源头的本质是创造无数的自身片段，并引导每个片段凝聚成一个主有机体，同时允许每个片段保留其主权。这是爱的完美赐予。

虽然无法通过寻找找到第一源泉，但如果你愿意服从你内心的主权实体的领导冲动，你将会被一步步地引导，一生又一生，穿过一个又一个的宇宙，一个又一个的时代，直到你最终窥视你的创造者的眼睛，意识到你是一个人。在这种认识中，你将看到你所产生的物种也是一个。一体的碎片通过探索的蓝图凝结在一起，而探索的结束是无法预见的，探索的开始也无法用时间来衡量。
