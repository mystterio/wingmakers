Chamber Two – The Shifting Models of Existence
The consciousness of the Sovereign Integral is the destination that beckons the human instrument inward into the reality of First Source. In all the wanderings of the human consciousness from Source Reality, it has eliminated the compelling features of Source Reality through the application of the logical mind and the persistent belief in the language of limitation that flows from the external controls of the hierarchy.

Source Reality, hidden behind language, has gradually become “illuminated” by the prophets of your world, and has thus taken on the image of language rather than the expression of its compelling features. Language is the purveyor of limitation. It is the pawn of tyranny and entrapment. Virtually all entities within the time-space universe desire to preserve a dependence upon a hierarchy that stretches between the individual and the compelling features of Source Reality. It is the hierarchy that utilizes language as a form of structural limitation, though in relative terms, it can appear to be liberating and empowering.

Source Reality is the dwelling place of First Source, and it dances outside of the constructs of any language. It is complete within itself, and has a singular purpose of demonstrating the collective potential of all species within the Universe of Wholeness. It is the archetype of perfection. It is the standard bearer of each entity’s innate design and ultimate destiny. ITS essence is so far beyond conception that the human instrument’s tendency is to resort to the language of externals—and ultimately the hierarchy—to define Source Reality.

The hierarchy, through the purveyance of an evolution/saviorship model of existence, has attempted to guide the development of all entities throughout the Universe of Wholeness. The connection between the individual and the Source is subtly undermined through the layers of language, belief system manipulation, and ritual controls designed by the hierarchy to intervene between the spiritual essence of entities and their source, First Source.

Each individual must know their self to be free of all forms of external reliance. This is not to imply that one should not trust others or band together in alliances of friendship and community. It is simply a warning that relative truth is constantly shifting in the hands of those who desire to control, and even though their motives may be of good will, it is still a form of control. When the hierarchy withholds information, the interpretive centers for relative truth are positioned to acquire and maintain power rather than dispensing the empowerment of Source equality.

There are so many layers of relative truth that if you listen to the language of externals, you will most likely abandon your own power in favor of the proclamation of language. Language is seductive to the ego’s drive for power and control, as well as the mind’s inclination to surrender to, and believe in, the language of externals. It can lure the unsuspecting into believing images and ideas—real or imagined—for the sake of holding individuals in bondage to a lesser truth, or keep individuals supporting the hierarchy when it no longer serves a purpose. The time is fast approaching when the veils of control at all levels of the Hierarchy will be rendered obsolete by entities who are destined to pull down the veils and allow sovereign power to prevail over hierarchical power.

There are entities that have woven their future existence with terra-earth and are destined to demonstrate the truth of Source equality among all entities at all levels of expression. It will become the fundamental purpose of the Hierarchy to slowly remove these barriers to equality in such a way that the hierarchy appears to be the savior of consciousness rather than the guard of consciousness. There are those present who will ensure that the curtain falls swiftly for those who are ready to be equal with their Source; are willing to skirt the hierarchy’s tangled pathways; and embrace their divinity as sovereign expressions of Source Reality.

The hierarchy represents diverse interests, perceptions of reality, and motives of action. It is this diversity that causes the hierarchy to become ineffective in leading individuals to their equal status with First Source. However, this diversity is also what permits the hierarchy to attract and initially awaken such a breadth of individuals to their spiritual energies and intuitive centers. Nevertheless, the hierarchy has trapped itself in diversity and vested specialization that prevents it from evolving from an arduous ladder of evolution to a joyous river of Light that is aligned with the purpose of empowering entities to Source equality.

The saviorship concept results from the feelings of inadequacy that constantly surge within the mass consciousness of humanity through the genetic mind. These feelings are related to the fragmentation of the human instrument and its inability—while fragmented—to fully grasp its own wholeness perspective and reach into its divine origins and accept itself as equal with First Source. Thus ensues the seemingly endless search to be saved from the inadequacy and insecurity that result from the fragmentation of the human instrument.

The motive to evolve consciousness derives from the feeling of being less than whole. And in particular, the feeling of being disconnected from First Source due to imperfect judgment caused by the fragmentation of the human instrument. It is through these feelings that the fragmentation perpetuates itself for the entire species and is passed into the genetic mind, which is the shared foundation of the human instrument. The genetic mind of the human species is the single most powerful component of the Hierarchy and it is formed by the very conditions of the human instrument living in a three-dimensional, five-sensory context that is all-consuming.

When the entity initially enters a human instrument at birth, it is immediately fragmented into a physical, emotional, and mental spectrum of perception and expression. From that day forward the entity is carefully conditioned to adapt into, and navigate within, the three-dimensional, five-sensory context of terra-earth. In effect, the entity purposely fragments its consciousness in order to experience separation from wholeness.

In this state of separation, the entity has handicapped itself for the purpose of new experience and a deeper understanding of the Primal Blueprint or grand vision of First Source. Through this deeper understanding, the entity can, through the human instrument, transform the three-dimensional context into a self-aware, integrated component of the Universe of Wholeness. This magnificent and purposeful endeavor produces the urge within the human instrument to seek out its wholeness and re-experience its divine connection to First Source.

This search, in large measure, is the fuel that drives the individual to seek out and explore the evolution/saviorship model of existence. It provides the individual with the motivation to seek help and guidance from a specific subgroup of the hierarchy, and in so doing, develop a sense of belonging and unity. It is this very same sense of belonging and unity that helps to catalyze a growing awareness of the underlying union between the human instrument, the Entity Consciousness, the Universe of Wholeness, Source Intelligence, and First Source.

This is why the evolution/saviorship model is so critical as a component to the Grand Experiment. It is the stage whereby the human instrument develops a sense of unity and belonging. A sense of relationship to some grand and encompassing vision. This is why the hierarchy nurtures saviors. It is also why the feelings of inadequacy and insecurity are developed and nurtured by the hierarchy. It actually hastens the unification of humanity, which in turn, will hasten and lead to the unification of humanity with the Universe of Wholeness.

Spiritual leaders are able to peer deeply beneath the surface reality of life and experience how intricately connected every life form is, and how this composite of life is intelligent far beyond the human instrument’s capability to both perceive and express. It is because of this condition that spiritual leaders can only interpret reality through their personal abilities to perceive and express life’s dimensional depth and limitless intelligence. No one is able to articulate life’s dimensional depth and breadth with the tools of language. They can only, at best, describe their interpretation or their impressions.

Every human is able, in varying degrees, to peer beneath the surface reality of life and perceive and express their personal interpretations of the Universe of Wholeness. They require only the time and intention to develop their own interpretations. And this is precisely what all the great spiritual leaders have taught. Life’s deeper meaning is not an absolute to be experienced by the chosen few, but an evolving, dynamic intelligence that wears as many faces as there are life forms. No life form or species has the exclusive portal into the Universe of Wholeness in which First Source expresses ITSELF in all ITS majesty. The portal is shared with all because First Source is within all things.

The Shifting Models of Existence
The great spiritual leaders of terra-earth have all, in their own way, interpreted the Universe of Wholeness and humanity’s role therein. In so doing, their interpretations, because they were articulated with authority and depth of insight, became a target of debate among various subgroups of the hierarchy. This debate and inquiry process creates a polarity of belief. A sympathetic constituency will emerge to defend and embellish their particular leader’s interpretation, while everyone else will hold it in contempt of previously held beliefs.

This peculiar method of creating a religion that is fixated on a savior’s or prophet’s interpretation of the Universe of Wholeness is unique to a species that is exploring the evolution/saviorship model of existence. The spiritual leaders that are recognized as great prophets or saviors have produced a vision of the Universe of Wholeness beyond what was currently defined by the hierarchy. They created a new portal into the Universe of Wholeness and were willing to share their vision at the expense of debate and probable ridicule.

These men and women were the gateways for humanity to explore new facets of itself. To engage a part of its oversoul or universal consciousness that was essential at that particular time in its evolutionary cycle. But the leader’s interpretations too often become interpreted by the followers who desire to create a religion or sect, and the vision quietly recedes into the hands of the Hierarchy where it becomes de-vitalized by the very fact that it is connected to a massive structure that both protects and promotes it.

First Source is connected to individuals not organizations. Thus, the hierarchy is unconnected to the Source in a vital and dynamic way. The hierarchy is more connected to its own collective desire to help, to serve, to perform a function that allows the use of power to drive toward the vision of its leaders. In itself, this is not wrong or misguided. It is all part of the Primal Blueprint that orchestrates the unfoldment of consciousness from First Source to entity, and entity to Collective Source. This is the spiral of integration that breeds wholeness and cascading beauty within Source Intelligence.

What the hierarchy has loosely labeled as Spirit comes as close as any word to the symbol of Source Intelligence. Source Intelligence inhabits all fields of vibration as an extension of the Source. It is the emissary of First Source that interweaves with the hierarchy as its counter-balance. Source Intelligence is the factor of integrity and alignment, which ensures that the hierarchy is serving its purpose within the Primal Blueprint. Source Intelligence is, in effect, the “scientist” who oversees the Grand Experiment and establishes the criteria, selects the variables, monitors the results, and evaluates the alternative outcomes in the laboratory of time and space.

The Grand Experiment is the ongoing transformation and expansion of Source Intelligence through all entities in all dimensions of existence. It is the purpose of the Grand Experiment to test alternative models of existence to determine, with some certainty, the model that is best able to unify consciousness without impinging on the sovereignty of the entity and First Source. The Grand Experiment is composed of many distinct stages that interlink, leading to the Great Mystery. Most of these different stages are being simultaneously played out within the time-space universe in order to prepare the universe for the impending expansion of Source Reality into all dimensions of existence.

In the case of terra-earth, this is the stage of existence that promotes the clear connection of individual consciousness to the compelling features of Source Reality without the intervention of a hierarchy of any kind. This is when the fables and myths of history step into the light and become known as they truly are and have been. This is the time when language will be transmuted into a new form of communication that exhibits the compelling features of Source Reality in an artistry of energy and vibration that break down all barriers of control.

It is time to recognize that the hierarchy extends throughout the cosmos to the very borders of discovery. It has branches that extend from every star system, every known dimension; and virtually all life forms are “leaves” of this vast cosmological tree. This constitutes the grand indoctrination of species, spirits, planets, and stars as they each evolve through the branches of the tree. Thus, the hierarchy is an assemblage of externals that desire to invest their energies in support of a sub-group that has nested somewhere within the greatest of all structures—the hierarchy. Service is the operational motive of the hierarchy, and in most cases, this translates into the concept of saviorship and the teacher/student ordering of the universe.

The hierarchy is composed of all entities of all motives that have linked their energies into sub-groups. These sub-groups are independent branches of the vast, cosmological tree that encompasses all things outside of Source Reality. The roots of the tree are bound in the soil of genetic memory and subconscious instincts. At the base of the tree the first branches sprout and they are the oldest, representing the native religions of the species. The middle branches are the orthodox religions and institutions, while the upper branches represent the contemporary belief systems that are newly emerging throughout the universe. The whole tree, in this definition, is the hierarchy, and its seed was initially conceived, planted, and nurtured by Source Intelligence for the purpose of stimulating the Grand Experiment.

This is the experiment of transformation versus evolution. Evolution is the arduous and ongoing process of shifting positions within the hierarchy—always assessing your present position in relation to a new one that beckons you. Transformation is simply the recognition that there are accelerated pathways that bypass the hierarchy leading to sovereign mastership rather than interdependent saviorship, and that these new pathways can be accessed through direct experience of the equality tone-vibration that is present within all entities.

This tone vibration is not what is more commonly referred to as the music of the spheres or the vibration of spirit moving through the universe in resonance to Source intention. It is a vibration that holds together the three principles of the transformational experience: Universe relationship through gratitude, observance of Source in all things, and the nurturance of life. The application of these life-principles in a specific equation of conduct de-couples an entity from the controlling elements of the hierarchy.

How can the hierarchy act in the role of an interpretive center of truth without manipulating entities, and thus, obscuring their free will? The Grand Experiment was designed with free will as its primary method of obtaining authentic information that can be used to expand Source Reality to all dimensions of existence. Free will is the thread of authenticity that imbues value in the various tests within the Grand Experiment. The hierarchy or any other external structure never jeopardizes free will. Only the entity can choose their reality, and this is the fundamental principle of free will.

Free will is not obscured simply because an entity is presented with alternative realities or relative truths that delay its realization of Source equality. It is the choice of the entity to invest itself in external accounts of reality instead of delving within its own resources and creating a reality that is sovereign. The value of free will is always expanding as you move towards sovereignty, and in like manner, is always diminishing as you move towards external dependence. The choice between sovereignty or external dependence is the basis of free will, and there is no structure or external source that can eliminate this basic choice. It is an inward choice that, regardless of outward circumstance, is incapable of being denied by anything external.

The Universe of Wholeness encompasses all dimensions (including Source Reality), and therefore, all realities are contained therein. In this incomprehensible diversity, each entity is provided a structure that defines their free will in terms of its relation to Source Reality. Each of these structures varies in latitude of choice, but each is connected into the superstructure of the hierarchy. The structureless reality of Source Reality is where free will was initially conceived, and when the principle expanded into the time-space universe as the thread of authenticity, it became increasingly dependent upon the entity’s recognition of its wholeness in relation to Source Intelligence.

If the entity was fragmented into its component parts, its comprehension of free will was limited to that which the hierarchy circumscribed. If the entity is a conscious collective, realizing its sovereign wholeness, the principle of free will was a form of structure that was unnecessary, like a fire in a summer’s day. When entities are unknowing of their wholeness, structure will occur as a form of self-imposed security. Through this ongoing development of a structured and ordered universe, entities defined their borders—their limits—through the expression of their insecurity. They gradually became pieces of their wholeness, and like shards of glass from a beautiful vase they bear little resemblance to their aggregate beauty.

If you were to perceive the origin of your existence, you would undoubtedly see how vast the entity is. If you could pierce through the veils that cover your destiny, you would understand how much vaster you will become. Between these two points of existence—origin and destiny—the entity is always the vibrant container of Source Intelligence. It has willingly allowed itself to explore the time-space universes as an outpost of First Source. Therefore, while the Hierarchy may obscure the entity’s comprehension of its wholeness, it is the entity who has surrendered, by choice, to listen to the language of limitation, the proclamations of externals, and become seduced by the model of evolution/saviorship.

Why has the hierarchy not provided the alternative model of transformation/mastership and enabled the entity to make a choice, and in so doing, truly exercise its free will? It is because the hierarchy, like most entities, is not aware of its wholeness. Its fragments, or subgroups, are completely devoted to boundaries. Where there are boundaries that define and limit, there is also structure. Where there is deeply ingrained structure there is a pervasive belief that transformation is impossible. Naturally, the time-space universe conforms to the matrix of belief projection, and the very concept of transformation is removed from the hierarchy’s reality.

Thus, the hierarchy is unable to even conceptualize the model of transformation/mastership with any precision, let alone inform the entity that alternatives exist which issue from Source Intelligence. The hierarchy is not responsible for this condition, each entity is. The dominant model of Source Intelligence is primal. It existed before the hierarchy. It is the entity that has chosen to explore the hierarchy’s model of existence for the purpose of participating in the Grand Experiment and assisting in the emergence of the synthesis model of existence. The hierarchy is quite benign as a manipulative force, and merely represents a key ingredient to the recipe of wholeness that is transforming the entity to reach beyond its role as a vibrant container of Source Intelligence, and become the bridgeway in the expansion of Source Reality into the time-space universes.

There is an ancient belief, born of the hierarchy, that the time-space universes will ascend into Source Reality and the human instrument of love will accompany this ascension process. However, it is Source Reality that is expanding to encompass the time-space universes with the purpose of aligning all entities to the synthesis model of existence. Source Intelligence is stripping away the veils that hide the true meaning of the entity model of expression in the time-space universes. When this occurs, the entity will possess Source equality in all dimensions and fields of vibration, and its componentry will be united for the full expression of its sovereign perspective.

This transformation of the entity is the pathway into wholeness and the recognition that the entity model of expression is a composite of forms and the formless that is unified in one energy, one consciousness. When the fragments are aligned and inter-connected, the entity becomes the instrument that facilitates Source Reality expansion. Thus, the entity does not ascend from the time-space universes, but rather coalesces into a state of wholeness whereby its sovereign expression can assist in the expansion, or in a different context, the descent, of Source Reality into the time-space universes.

Ascension is often construed as the natural outcome of evolution. That all planetary systems and species are evolving to the point where they ascend from limitation, and that eventually, the time-space universes will somehow fold into Source Reality and cease to exist as fields of vibration. It is actually quite the opposite. Source Reality is descending. It is inclusive of all things, and it is the Source intention to expand, not retreat. The entity transforms to wholeness within the cradle of the time-space universe, and, in so doing, becomes the accessory of Source Reality’s intention to expand.

Can you see the perfection of this Primal Blueprint? Can you feel the shifting of the matrix from which your reality is cast? Can you not also understand that you, the human instrument, consist of a componentry that is individuated as a single point of pure energy, yet live in many places on many dimensions simultaneously? Only within the entity is the place of transformation discovered, where the formless Self can enter and commune with its various outposts of form. The formless is the Eternal Watcher who lives behind the veil of form and comprehension, and draws forth the wisdom of time from the well of planets. It is the point of origination from whence Source Intelligence flows.

The Eternal Watcher is the only real interpretive center for the entity. It is the only stable guidance system that can propel the entity to its wholeness. Thus, the entity is composed of both the formless identity of Source Intelligence and the formful identity of densified energy. While the formless is one, the formful is divested in many fragments of expression that isolate its consciousness as islands of perception and expression. This condition results in the entity’s denial of its vast and glorious nature of existence.

In the human instrument, the entity, for the most part, is silent and unmoving. It appears like a fleeting whisper of gladness that touches you like a mountain wind. It is quiet like a deep ocean. Yet, the entity is coming forward into the time-space universe as a harbinger of Source Reality expansion. It is beginning to make itself known as it truly is. Many feel the shadow of their entity as it approaches. They consign all forms of definition to this “shadow”, seldom believing it to be the torchbearer of their total selfhood. Here is where all the vows of faithfulness, all the ceremonies of love, and all the feelings of hope should be centered and given over to the sovereign entity that each of us is.

The primary reason that the hierarchy’s model of evolution/saviorship is so compelling is because the entity has become fragmented in how it perceives its total selfhood. The Eternal Watcher that lives through the human instrument is illusive to the time-space conditioned mind, yet it is the mind that attempts to reach out and touch this subtle vibration of Source equality that is forever kindled by Source Intelligence. However, the mind is too conditioned and disempowered to realize the total scope of the entity that exists beyond the shadows of intuition. It is for this reason that the species is exploring the evolution/saviorship model of existence. They have little or no conception of their wholeness, and require a savior and the acclimation process of evolution to bring them security and happiness.

It is a natural condition of an evolving species to have a desire, implanted by the hierarchy, to be saved and to be a savior. This condition results in the teacher/student ordering of the universe, and it is a building block of evolution and the very essence of the hierarchy’s structural existence. While some species resort to the drama of survival to catalyze their evolutionary progress, other species resort to the drama of being saved and being a savior. The saviorship drama is an expression of sovereign entities that are preoccupied with the evolutionary process, and it is not confined to a religious context, but indeed applies to all facets of one’s life.

As there are relative truths, there are relative freedoms. If you are evolving through the hierarchical process you gain an ever-increasing sense of freedom, yet you are still controlled by the vibration of externals through languages, thought forms, frequencies of color and sound, and the seemingly indelible artifacts of the genetic mind. Each of these elements can cause the human instrument to rely upon the hierarchy as it overlays a sense of inequality between you and your Source. The underlying equation of the evolutionary process is human instrument + Hierarchy = God connection. In the case of the transformational process, it is Entity + Source Intelligence = First Source equality.

Source Intelligence, though it generally manifests as the vibration of equality, is subject to the will of First Source, and as the Source intention changes through the various stages of the Grand Experiment, Source Intelligence is also changing its form of manifestation. This change is occurring now within the worlds of time and space because First Source is beginning to set the stage for the integration of the two primary models of existence (evolution/saviorship and transformation/mastership) within the Grand Experiment.

The time has come to integrate the dominant model of the Hierarchy (evolution/saviorship) with the dominant model of Source Intelligence (transformation/mastership). This integration can only be achieved at the level of the entity. It cannot occur within the context of a human instrument or an aspect of the hierarchy. Only the entity—the wholeness of inter-dimensional sovereignty imbued with Source Intelligence—can facilitate and fully experience the integration of these two models of existence.

This form of integration occurs when the entity fully explores the two models and develops a synthesis model that positions saviorship as an internal role of the entity to “save” itself, and not rely upon externals to perform this liberating task. This act of self-sufficiency begins to integrate the saviorship idea with the mastership realization. The next step is to integrate the time-based incremental progress of the evolutionary model with the realization-based acceptance of the transformation model. This is done when the entity is thoroughly convinced that experience and utilization of its wholeness can only occur when it is completely detached from the various structures of the hierarchy.

While the entity assumes its role of personal liberation, it does not mean that the hierarchy is to be shunned or avoided. The hierarchy is a wondrous instrument. It is symbolic of the body of First Source, enabling IT to submerge within the time-space universes similar to how the human instrument allows the entity to function outside of Source Reality. The hierarchy is a vehicle of transformation even when it acts to suppress information and keep species in obedience to its controlling hand. It is part of the ancient formula that prepares a new universe for the synthesis model of existence and membership in the Universe of Wholeness.

The combination of self-saviorship and detachment from the hierarchy initiates the synthesis model into manifestation. The synthesis model is the next outcome of the Grand Experiment, and in certain vibrational fields of the multidimensional universe, there are entities who are indeed experiencing this stage of the experiment as forerunners of the entity model of Source individuation.

These entities are specifically designed to transmit this future experience into communication symbols and life principles that facilitate the bridging of the two models of existence. Beyond the initial design and construction of these “bridges,” these entities will remain largely unknown. If they were to do anything more, they would rapidly become a fixture of the Hierarchy and their missions would become compromised.

These Sovereign Entities are not present in the time-space universe to be formal teachers. They are present to be catalysts and designers. They are present to ensure that Source Intelligence is allowed to balance the dominant force of the Hierarchy and its model of evolution/saviorship. They will not create a new belief system. Instead, they will focus on developing new communication symbols through various art forms that facilitate the entity’s detachment from the controlling aspects of the hierarchy. The Sovereign Entities will also demonstrate the natural ease of interweaving the two primary strands of existence into a synthesis model.

In the advancing epoch of human development, entities will collectively design new pathways beyond the synthesis model of existence so that a new hierarchy can be constructed that is fashioned from Source Intelligence information. This new hierarchy will be cast from the knowledge gained from the Grand Experiments of the time-space universes, and the cosmic cycle will regenerate itself into a new field of vibration and existence. This new model of existence resists definition, and word-symbols are completely inadequate to describe even the shadowy outlines of this new form of existence that is emerging from out of the synthesis model in your future time.

The WingMakers are Sovereign Entities who will be transforming time-space universes from ladders of consciousness to inclusions of Source Reality. In other words, Source Reality will be extended into time-space universes, and all life forms therein will experience this extension through a new hierarchical structure that is completely aligned with Source Intelligence. What some call “heaven on earth” is merely an echo-realization of this impending future time. What is truly bearing down on the time-space universes is the expansion of Source Reality through the accessibility of Source Intelligence information to all entities regardless of form or structure.

When this accessibility is complete and the Source Coding is fully activated, all entities will be part of a new cosmological structure. This new structure will invoke the next model of existence, which is already being developed within Source Reality by Source Intelligence and the Sovereign Entities. What is being activated now upon this time-space universe is the initial preparations for these shifts in the models of existence. More specifically, upon terra-earth, these models of existence will be simultaneously played out over the next epoch of time. As always, it will be the choice of the entity as to which model they embrace as reality.

These various models of existence will generally occur in a predetermined sequence, but not necessarily in a predetermined time frame. The sequence of Source Reality expansion is: Source Intelligence creation of new fields of vibration; the ongoing development of an entity constructed hierarchy to act as the superstructure of the new creation; the emergence from the hierarchy of a dominant model of existence, in this case, the evolution/saviorship model; the introduction of the Source Intelligence model of existence, in this case, the transformation/ mastership model; the intermixing of these two models to form a synthesis model of Source equality; and finally, Source Reality expansion to the inclusion of all dimensions and entities.

When this sequencing of the Primal Blueprint is achieved, the process, with all that has been learned by Source Intelligence, will be reconfigured and a new element of the Primal Blueprint will be revealed that is unknown at this stage even by Source Intelligence. The time required to fulfill the complete cycle is undetermined, but it is reasonable to expect that its completion is yet so distant in time that to attach measurement is simply a feeble attempt at estimating the unknowable.

Let there be no mistake, however, that the fulfillment of the Primal Blueprint is indeed the direction all entities are traveling. While entities of all levels are bestowed free will within their own realities, they are not, as aspects of Source Reality, given free will to choose their ultimate destiny. The origin of entities is Source Intelligence, and it is Source Intelligence that determines destiny as well as origin. Still, entities are provided tremendous latitude of choices to propel themselves from origin to destiny and re-emerge into an expanded version of Source Reality with a renewed vision of their identity.

All the highest imaginings of the human instrument are yet unaware of the deepest foundation of the Primal Blueprint. They have sought the upper reaches of the building, and remain unaware of the foundation’s design. It is here, at the very bottom of existence that First Source is bursting forth with ITS energy and is retreating with ITS equality of sovereign mastership. It is here that equality is realized, not in the lofty places of relative truth lodged in the hierarchy, but in the deepest part of the foundational plan of life’s origins and destiny, where time rejoins itself into timelessness. The origin and destiny of existence is the tone of equality in life. Listen for this tone—this frequency of vibration—and follow it back into the very foundation from whence all things arise and return.

This frequency of the tone-vibration of equality is only heard with the seventh sense by the entity who is enveloped in a human instrument. The seventh sense can be developed by the time capsules and will lead certain entities to their innermost or core expression. The core expression is what activates the seventh sense. Thus, before one can hear the tone-vibration of equality, they must gain access to their core expression. There is encoded in each of the time capsules, a system of languages that can lead the individual to their core expression. It is hidden because it is so powerful. And we will only lead the worthy to this power.

Consider these words as symbols only. Remember that language is a tool of limitation. Feeling is an antidote of limitation that permits the human instrument to leap over the boundaries of the logical mind and witness firsthand the wordless power of collective energy individuated. Feel the truth that stands behind the symbols, and tap into this energy-force that reaches out for you. Know it as a tone-vibration—a resonance that waits for you around every corner in which your life will turn. It is the beacon of the Source Vibration gathering itself into the form of language in order to usher you to the place from which you can experience the formless tone of equality; the bypass of limitation; the Primal Language of Source Intelligence that bestows to you the freedom to generate your deepest beauty in the expression of the highest truth.

第二厅--存在模式的转变
主权整体的意识是召唤人类工具向内进入第一源的现实的目的地。在人类意识远离源头现实的所有徘徊中，它通过应用逻辑思维和坚持相信来自等级制度外部控制的限制语言，消除了源头现实的引人注目的特征。

隐藏在语言背后的源头现实，已经逐渐被你们世界的先知们 "照亮"，从而具有了语言的形象，而不是表达其引人注目的特征。语言是限制的传播者。它是暴政和禁锢的棋子。几乎所有时空宇宙中的实体都希望保持对一个等级制度的依赖，这个等级制度延伸到个人和源头现实的引人注目的特征之间。这个等级制度利用语言作为一种结构性限制的形式，尽管相对而言，它似乎是解放和授权的。

源头现实是第一源头的居住地，它在任何语言的构造之外起舞。它本身是完整的，并有一个独特的目的，即在整体性的宇宙中展示所有物种的集体潜力。它是完美的原型。它是每个实体的先天设计和最终命运的标准承载者。它的本质是如此的超乎想象，以至于人类工具的倾向是诉诸于外部的语言--最终是等级制度--来定义源泉现实。

等级制度通过对存在的进化/奴役模式的宣传，试图指导整个宇宙中所有实体的发展。个人与源头之间的联系通过层层的语言、信仰系统的操纵和等级制度设计的仪式控制被巧妙地破坏了，以干预实体的精神本质和他们的源头--第一源。

每个人都必须知道他们的自我，以摆脱一切形式的外部依赖。这并不是说一个人不应该信任他人或在友谊和社区的联盟中团结起来。这只是一个警告，相对真理在那些渴望控制的人手中不断变化，即使他们的动机可能是善意的，但这仍然是一种控制形式。当等级制度扣留信息时，相对真理的解释中心被定位为获取和维持权力，而不是发放源头平等的授权。

相对真理的层次太多，如果你听从外在的语言，你很可能会放弃自己的力量，而选择语言的宣扬。语言对自我的权力和控制的驱动力具有诱惑力，也对心灵的倾向性具有诱惑力，使人屈服于并相信外在的语言。它可以引诱毫无戒心的人相信图像和想法--真实的或想象的--以便将个人束缚在一个较小的真理中，或者在等级制度不再起作用时让个人继续支持这个制度。时间很快就到了，等级制度各个层面的控制面纱将被那些注定要拉下面纱并允许主权权力战胜等级制度权力的实体所淘汰。

有一些实体将它们的未来存在与地球交织在一起，并注定要在所有的表达层面上证明所有实体之间源头平等的真理。慢慢地消除这些平等的障碍将成为等级制度的基本目的，使等级制度看起来是意识的拯救者，而不是意识的守卫者。有一些人将确保那些准备好与他们的源头平等的人迅速落下帷幕；他们愿意绕过等级制度的纠缠不清的路径；并拥抱他们作为源头现实的主权表达的神性。

等级制度代表了不同的利益、对现实的看法和行动的动机。正是这种多样性导致等级制度在引导个人与第一源头的平等地位方面变得毫无效果。然而，这种多样性也使得等级制度能够吸引并初步唤醒如此广泛的个人的精神能量和直觉中心。然而，等级制度把自己困在多样性和既得的专业化中，使它无法从艰巨的进化阶梯发展到欢乐的光之河流，而这一河流与赋予实体与源平等的目的相一致。

救世主的概念来自于人类的大众意识中通过遗传思维不断涌现的不足感。这些感觉与人类工具的分裂有关，以及它在分裂时无法完全掌握自己的整体性观点，无法进入其神圣的本源，无法接受自己与第一源头平等。因此，随之而来的是看似无止境的寻找，以从人类工具的分裂所导致的不充分和不安全中得到拯救。

进化意识的动机来自于不太完整的感觉。特别是，由于人类工具的分裂造成的不完美判断而与第一源头脱节的感觉。正是通过这些感觉，碎片化为整个物种延续了自己，并被传递到遗传心灵中，这是人类工具的共同基础。人类物种的遗传心智是层次结构中唯一最强大的组成部分，它是由人类工具生活在一个三维、五种感官环境中的条件所形成的，是无所不包的。

当实体在出生时最初进入人类工具时，它立即被分割成身体、情感和精神的感知和表达范围。从那一天起，实体被精心调教，以适应并驾驭地球上的三维五感环境。实际上，实体有目的地将自己的意识碎片化，以体验与整体的分离。

在这种分离状态下，实体为了获得新的经验和对原始蓝图或第一源头的宏伟愿景有更深的理解而使自己陷入困境。通过这种更深入的理解，实体可以通过人类工具将三维环境转化为自我意识，成为整体性宇宙的综合组成部分。这种宏伟而有目的的努力产生了人类工具内的冲动，以寻求其整体性并重新体验其与第一源的神圣联系。

这种寻找，在很大程度上，是推动个人寻找和探索进化/奴隶制存在模式的燃料。它为个人提供了动力，使其能够向等级制度中的特定子群体寻求帮助和指导，并在此过程中发展出一种归属感和统一性。正是这种归属感和统一性，有助于催化对人类工具、实体意识、整体性宇宙、源头智能和第一源头之间的基本结合的认识的增长。

这就是为什么进化/奴隶制模式作为大实验的一个组成部分是如此关键。它是人类工具发展出统一感和归属感的阶段。一种与某种宏大和包容的愿景的关系感。这就是为什么等级制度培养救世主的原因。这也是为什么等级制度会发展和培养不充分和不安全的感觉。它实际上加速了人类的统一，而这又会加速并导致人类与整体性宇宙的统一。

精神领袖能够深入窥视生命的表面现实，并体验到每个生命形式是如何错综复杂地联系在一起，以及这种生命的复合体的智慧是如何远远超出人类工具的感知和表达能力。正是由于这种情况，精神领袖只能通过他们个人的能力来解释现实，以感知和表达生命的维度深度和无限的智慧。没有人能够用语言的工具来表达生命的维度深度和广度。他们最多只能描述他们的解释或他们的印象。

每个人都能在不同程度上窥视生活的表面现实，感知并表达他们对整体性宇宙的个人解释。他们只需要时间和意图来发展自己的解释。而这正是所有伟大的精神领袖所教导的。生命的深层意义不是少数人所能体验到的绝对，而是一种不断发展的、动态的智慧，它有多少种生命形式，就有多少种面貌。没有任何生命形式或物种拥有进入整体性宇宙的专属门户，第一源泉在其中表达自己的所有威严。这个入口是与所有人共享的，因为第一源头就在万物之中。

存在模式的转变
地球上伟大的精神领袖们都以自己的方式解释了 "整体性宇宙 "和人类在其中的作用。在这样做的过程中，他们的解释因为具有权威性和深刻的洞察力而成为等级制度中各个分组的辩论目标。这种辩论和探究过程创造了信仰的极性。一个有同情心的选民会出现，为他们特定的领导人的解释进行辩护和美化，而其他人则会认为这是对以前持有的信念的蔑视。

这种创造宗教的奇特方法，固定在救世主或先知对整体性宇宙的解释上，是一个正在探索进化/救世主存在模式的物种所特有的。被公认为伟大的预言家或救世主的精神领袖产生了一个超越目前等级制度所定义的整体性宇宙的愿景。他们创造了一个新的门户，进入整体性宇宙，并愿意以辩论和可能的嘲笑为代价分享他们的愿景。

这些男人和女人是人类探索自身新面貌的门户。在人类进化周期的那个特定时期，让其超然的灵魂或普遍的意识参与其中是至关重要的。但是，领袖的解释往往被那些希望创建宗教或教派的追随者所解释，而愿景则悄悄地退到了等级制度的手中，在那里，由于它与一个既保护又促进它的庞大结构相连，它变得失去了活力。

第一源头与个人而非组织相连。因此，等级制度与源头的联系是没有生命力和活力的。等级制度更多的是与自己的集体愿望相联系，即帮助、服务、执行一种功能，允许使用权力来推动其领导人的愿景。这本身并不是错误或误导。这都是原始蓝图的一部分，它安排了从第一源头到实体，以及实体到集体源头的意识展开。这是整合的螺旋，在源头智慧中孕育着整体性和层叠的美。

等级制度松散地将其称为 "精神 "的东西，与源头智能的符号一样接近。源智能作为源的延伸，居住在所有的振动领域。它是第一源泉的使者，与等级制度交织在一起，作为其平衡。源智能是完整性和一致性的因素，它确保等级制度在原始蓝图中发挥其作用。实际上，源智能是监督大实验的 "科学家"，他制定标准，选择变量，监测结果，并在时间和空间的实验室中评估替代结果。

大实验是源智能通过所有实体在所有维度的存在进行的持续转变和扩展。大实验的目的是测试其他的存在模式，以确定在不影响实体和第一源泉的主权的情况下，最能统一意识的模式。大实验由许多不同的阶段组成，这些阶段相互联系，通向大秘境。这些不同的阶段大多是在时空宇宙中同时进行的，以便为源泉现实即将扩展到所有存在的维度而准备宇宙。

在地球的情况下，这是促进个人意识与源头现实的强制性特征明确联系的存在阶段，没有任何形式的等级制度的干预。这时，历史上的寓言和神话走进了光明，并以其真实的面目和一直以来的面目出现。这时，语言将被转化为一种新的交流形式，在能量和振动的艺术性中展示源泉现实的引人注目的特征，打破所有控制的障碍。

现在是时候认识到，这个等级制度延伸到整个宇宙，直到发现的边界。它的分支从每一个恒星系统、每一个已知的维度延伸出来；几乎所有的生命形式都是这棵巨大的宇宙树的 "叶子"。这构成了对物种、精神、行星和恒星的宏大灌输，因为它们各自通过这棵树的枝干进化。因此，等级制度是一个外部人的集合体，他们希望将自己的能量投入到支持一个子群体，这个子群体已经嵌套在所有结构中最伟大的某处--等级制度。服务是等级制度的运作动机，在大多数情况下，这转化为救世主的概念和宇宙的教师/学生秩序。

层次结构是由所有动机的实体组成的，它们将自己的能量连接成子群。这些子群体是巨大的、宇宙学的树的独立分支，包括源现实之外的所有事物。这棵树的根系被束缚在遗传记忆和潜意识本能的土壤中。在树的底部，第一批树枝发芽，它们是最古老的，代表物种的本土宗教。中间的枝条是正统的宗教和机构，而上面的枝条则代表整个宇宙新出现的当代信仰体系。在这个定义中，整棵树就是等级制度，它的种子最初是由源头智能构思、种植和培育的，目的是为了刺激大实验的进行。

这就是转型与进化的实验。进化是在等级制度中转移位置的艰巨而持续的过程--一直在评估你现在的位置与向你招手的新位置之间的关系。转化只是认识到，有一些加速的途径可以绕过等级制度，通向主权的主人地位，而不是相互依存的救主地位，而且这些新的途径可以通过直接体验所有实体中存在的平等的音调振动而获得。

这种音调振动不是通常所说的球体音乐，也不是精神在宇宙中移动的振动，而是与源头意图产生共鸣。它是一种振动，把转化经验的三个原则联系在一起。通过感恩建立宇宙关系，在所有事物中遵守源头，以及培育生命。这些生命原则在特定的行为方程式中的应用，使一个实体与等级制度的控制因素脱钩。

等级制度如何在不操纵实体的情况下发挥真理解释中心的作用，从而掩盖其自由意志？大实验的设计是以自由意志为主要方法，以获得真实的信息，可用于将源泉现实扩展到存在的所有层面。自由意志是真实性的主线，为大实验中的各种测试注入了价值。等级制度或任何其他外部结构从未危及自由意志。只有实体可以选择他们的现实，这就是自由意志的基本原则。

自由意志并不只是因为一个实体被呈现为替代性的现实或相对的真理而被遮蔽，从而延迟了它对源头平等的实现。它是实体选择将自己投入到外部的现实描述中，而不是深入到自己的资源中，创造一个具有主权的现实。自由意志的价值总是随着你走向主权而扩大，同样地，也总是随着你走向外部依赖而减少。在主权或外部依赖之间的选择是自由意志的基础，没有任何结构或外部来源可以消除这一基本选择。这是一个内在的选择，无论外在环境如何，都不可能被任何外在事物所否定。

整体性的宇宙包含了所有的维度（包括源现实），因此，所有的现实都包含在其中。在这种难以理解的多样性中，每个实体都被提供了一个结构，以其与源现实的关系来定义其自由意志。这些结构中的每一个在选择的纬度上都有所不同，但每一个都被连接到等级制度的上层建筑中。源泉现实的无结构现实是自由意志最初被设想的地方，当这一原则作为真实性的线索扩展到时间空间宇宙时，它越来越依赖于实体对其与源泉智能的整体性的认识。

如果实体被分割成其组成部分，它对自由意志的理解就被限制在等级制度所限定的范围内。如果实体是一个有意识的集体，实现其主权的整体性，那么自由意志的原则就是一种不必要的结构形式，就像夏日里的一把火。当实体不知道自己的整体性时，结构将作为一种自我施加的安全形式发生。通过这种结构化和有序的宇宙的持续发展，实体通过表达它们的不安全感来界定它们的边界--它们的极限。它们逐渐成为其整体性的碎片，就像美丽的花瓶上的玻璃碎片一样，与它们的整体之美几乎没有任何相似之处。

如果你能觉察到你存在的起源，你无疑会看到这个实体是多么庞大。如果你能穿透覆盖在你命运上的面纱，你就会明白你将变得多么宽广。在这两个存在点--起源和命运之间，实体始终是源头智能的充满活力的容器。它心甘情愿地允许自己作为第一源泉的前哨站探索时空宇宙。因此，虽然等级制度可能掩盖了实体对其整体性的理解，但它是实体通过选择而投降，听从限制的语言、外部的宣扬，并被进化/奴役的模式所诱惑。

为什么等级制度没有提供改造/领导的替代模式，使实体能够做出选择，并在此过程中真正行使其自由意志？这是因为等级制度，像大多数实体一样，没有意识到自己的整体性。它的碎片，或子集团，完全致力于边界。哪里有界定和限制的边界，哪里就有结构。在有根深蒂固的结构的地方，就有一种普遍的信念，即转变是不可能的。自然地，时空宇宙符合信念投射的矩阵，而转化的概念也从等级制度的现实中被移除。

因此，等级制度甚至无法准确地将转型/主宰的模式概念化，更不用说告知实体存在来自源头情报的替代品。等级制度对这种情况没有责任，每个实体都有责任。源泉智能的主导模式是最原始的。它在等级制度之前就存在了。它是选择探索等级制度的存在模式的实体，目的是参与大实验，协助综合存在模式的出现。层次结构作为一种操纵力量是非常良性的，它只是代表了整体性配方的一种关键成分，这种配方正在改变实体，使其超越其作为源泉智慧的充满活力的容器的角色，成为源泉现实扩展到时空宇宙的桥梁。

有一个古老的信念，诞生于等级制度，即时空宇宙将升入源头现实，而人类的爱的工具将伴随这个升华过程。然而，是源头现实正在扩展，以涵盖时空宇宙，目的是使所有实体与存在的综合模式保持一致。源智慧正在剥去掩盖实体在时空宇宙中的表达模式的真正含义的面纱。当这种情况发生时，实体将在所有维度和振动领域拥有源平等，其组成部分将被联合起来，充分表达其主权观点。

实体的这种转变是进入整体性的途径，并认识到实体的表达模式是一种形式和无形的组合，它统一于一种能量、一种意识。当这些碎片被对齐并相互连接时，实体就成为促进源头现实扩展的工具。因此，实体并不从时空宇宙中升起，而是凝聚成一种整体状态，从而使其主权表达能够协助源现实的扩张，或者在不同的背景下，下降到时空宇宙中。

升天往往被理解为进化的自然结果。所有的行星系统和物种都在进化到从限制中升华的地步，最终，时空宇宙将以某种方式折叠到源现实中，不再作为振动场存在。实际上，情况恰恰相反。源头现实正在下降。它包含了所有的事物，源头的意图是扩张，而不是退缩。实体在时空宇宙的摇篮中转变为整体，并在这样做的过程中，成为源泉现实扩展意图的附属品。

你能看到这个原始蓝图的完美性吗？你能感觉到你的现实所来自的矩阵的转变吗？你难道不能理解，你，人类的工具，是由一个组件组成的，它作为一个单一的纯能量点而独立存在，但同时生活在许多维度的许多地方？只有在实体内部才能发现转化的地方，在那里，无形的自我可以进入，并与它的各种形式的前哨进行交流。无形的自我是永恒的守望者，他生活在形式和理解的面纱后面，从行星的井中汲取时间的智慧。它是源头智慧的起源点，源头智慧从这里流出来。

永恒的守望者是该实体唯一真正的解释中心。它是唯一稳定的指导系统，可以推动实体达到其整体性。因此，实体是由源头智能的无形身份和密集能量的有形身份组成。无形的身份是一体的，而有形的身份则被剥离在许多表达的碎片中，这些碎片将其意识隔离为感知和表达的岛屿。这种状况导致了实体对其巨大而光荣的存在本质的否定。

在人类的工具中，实体，在大多数情况下，是沉默的，不动的。它的出现就像一个转瞬即逝的高兴的低语，像山风一样触动你。它安静得像一片深海。然而，这个实体作为源头现实扩张的预兆，正在向时空宇宙迈进。它正开始让人们知道它的真实面目。许多人感觉到他们的实体的阴影，因为它正在接近。他们把所有形式的定义都交给这个 "影子"，很少相信它是他们全部自我的火炬手。这里是所有忠诚的誓言、所有爱的仪式和所有希望的感觉的中心，并将其交给我们每个人的主权实体。

等级制度的进化/奴役模式如此引人注目的主要原因是，实体在如何感知其全部自我身份方面变得支离破碎。通过人类工具生活的永恒守望者对受时间空间条件限制的心灵来说是虚幻的，然而正是这个心灵试图伸出手来，触摸这个由源头智慧永远点燃的源头平等的微妙振动。然而，心灵被限制得太厉害，无法意识到存在于直觉阴影之外的实体的全部范围。正是由于这个原因，这个物种正在探索进化/奴役的存在模式。他们对自己的整体性几乎没有概念，需要一个救世主和进化的适应过程来带给他们安全和幸福。

有一种被等级制度植入的被拯救和成为救世主的欲望，是一个不断进化的物种的自然条件。这种条件导致了宇宙的教师/学生秩序，它是进化的一个组成部分，也是等级结构存在的本质。当一些物种诉诸于生存的戏剧来催化其进化的进展时，其他物种则诉诸于被拯救和成为救世主的戏剧。救世主戏剧是专注于进化过程的主权实体的表现，它并不局限于宗教背景，而是确实适用于一个人生活的所有方面。

既然有相对的真理，就有相对的自由。如果你通过等级制度的进化过程，你会获得越来越多的自由感，但你仍然被外部的振动所控制，通过语言、思想形式、颜色和声音的频率，以及遗传思想的似乎不可磨灭的人工制品。这些元素中的每一个都会导致人类工具对等级制度的依赖，因为它在你和你的源头之间叠加了一种不平等感。进化过程的基本等式是人类工具+等级制度=神的联系。在转化过程中，它是实体+源头智能=第一源头平等。

源头智慧虽然一般表现为平等的振动，但却受制于第一源头的意志，随着源头意图在大实验的各个阶段的变化，源头智慧也在改变其表现形式。这种变化现在正发生在时间和空间的世界里，因为第一源开始为大实验中两种主要的存在模式（进化/主宰和转化/主宰）的整合搭建舞台。

现在已经到了将等级制度的主导模式（进化/主宰）与源头智慧的主导模式（转化/主宰）整合的时候了。这种整合只能在实体的层面上实现。它不可能发生在人类工具或等级制度的某个方面。只有实体--被源智能所浸润的跨维度主权的整体，才能促进并充分体验这两种存在模式的整合。

当实体充分探索这两种模式并发展出一个综合模式，将救世主身份定位为实体 "拯救 "自己的内部角色，而不是依靠外部来完成这一解放任务时，这种形式的整合就发生了。这种自给自足的行为开始将救世主的思想与主人翁的意识结合起来。下一步是将进化模式中基于时间的渐进式进展与转型模式中基于实现的接受相结合。当实体彻底相信只有当它完全脱离等级制度的各种结构时，才能体验和利用其整体性，这就完成了。

虽然实体承担着个人解放的作用，但这并不意味着要回避或躲避等级制度。等级制度是一个奇妙的工具。它象征着第一源的身体，使IT能够淹没在时空宇宙中，类似于人类的工具允许实体在源现实之外运作。等级制度是转型的工具，即使它的行为是压制信息并使物种服从其控制的手。它是古老公式的一部分，为存在的综合模式和整体性宇宙的成员准备了一个新的宇宙。

自我主宰和脱离等级制度的结合，启动了综合模式的显现。综合模式是大实验的下一个结果，在多维宇宙的某些振动场中，有一些实体确实正在经历实验的这个阶段，作为源头个体化的实体模式的先驱。

这些实体被专门设计用来将这种未来的经验传送到交流符号和生活原则中，以促进两种存在模式的衔接。除了这些 "桥梁 "的最初设计和建造之外，这些实体将在很大程度上保持未知。如果他们要做更多的事情，他们将迅速成为等级制度的一个固定部分，他们的任务将受到影响。

这些主权实体在时空宇宙中的存在不是为了成为正式的教师。他们的存在是为了成为催化剂和设计师。他们的存在是为了确保源头智能被允许平衡等级制度的主导力量和它的进化/统治模式。他们不会创造一个新的信仰系统。相反，他们将专注于通过各种艺术形式开发新的交流符号，以促进实体从等级制度的控制方面脱离出来。主权实体还将展示将存在的两股主要力量交织成一个综合模式的自然轻松。

在人类发展的进步时代，实体将集体设计新的路径，超越存在的综合模式，这样就可以构建一个新的层次，这个层次是由源智能的信息形成的。这个新的等级制度将由从时空宇宙大实验中获得的知识铸成，宇宙循环将自我再生为一个新的振动和存在领域。这种新的存在模式拒绝定义，文字符号完全不足以描述这种新的存在形式的朦胧轮廓，这种存在形式正在你们未来的时间里从综合模式中出现。

造翼者是主权实体，他们将把时空宇宙从意识的阶梯转变为源泉现实的内含。换句话说，源泉现实将被扩展到时空宇宙中，其中的所有生命形式将通过与源泉智能完全一致的新等级结构来体验这种扩展。有些人所谓的 "人间天堂 "只是这个即将到来的未来时代的回声实现。真正压在时空宇宙上的是源泉现实的扩展，通过源泉智能信息对所有实体的可及性，无论其形式或结构如何。

当这种可及性完成后，源编码被完全激活，所有实体将成为新的宇宙结构的一部分。这个新的结构将调用下一个存在模式，这个模式已经由源头智能和主权实体在源头现实中开发。现在在这个时空宇宙中被激活的是为这些存在模式的转变所做的初步准备。更具体地说，在地球上，这些存在模式将在接下来的时间里同时发挥出来。像往常一样，将由实体选择他们接受哪种模式作为现实。

这些不同的存在模式一般会按照预定的顺序发生，但不一定是在预定的时间范围内。源泉现实扩展的顺序是：源泉智能创造新的振动领域；不断发展实体构建的等级制度，作为新创造的上层建筑；从等级制度中出现一个主导的存在模式，在这种情况下是进化/主人模式；引入源泉智能的存在模式，在这种情况下是转化/主人模式；这两种模式相互混合，形成源泉平等的综合模式；最后，源泉现实扩展到包含所有维度和实体。

当原始蓝图的这种排序实现后，这个过程，连同源头智慧所学到的一切，将被重新配置，原始蓝图的一个新元素将被揭示出来，在这个阶段，甚至源头智慧也不知道。完成整个周期所需的时间尚未确定，但可以合理地预期，它的完成在时间上是如此遥远，以至于附加测量只是对不可知的事物进行估计的一种微弱尝试。

然而，不要搞错了，原始蓝图的实现确实是所有实体正在行驶的方向。虽然所有层次的实体在他们自己的现实中被赋予了自由意志，但作为源泉现实的一部分，他们并没有被赋予自由意志来选择他们的最终命运。实体的起源是源头智能，是源头智能决定了命运和起源。然而，实体被提供了巨大的选择余地，以推动自己从起源到命运，并重新出现在源泉现实的扩大版本中，对自己的身份有了新的认识。

人类工具的所有最高想象力都还没有意识到原始蓝图的最深层基础。他们一直在寻求建筑的高层，但仍然不知道基础的设计。正是在这里，在存在的最底层，第一源泉以其能量迸发出来，并以其平等的主权主宰地位退却。正是在这里，平等得到了实现，不是在等级制度中相对真理的崇高位置，而是在生命的起源和命运的基础计划的最深处，在那里，时间重新连接到永恒。存在的起源和命运是生命中平等的音调。听听这个音调--这个振动的频率--并跟随它回到基础，万物从那里产生并返回。

这种平等的音调振动的频率，只有被人类工具包裹着的实体才能用第七感听到。第七感可以由时间胶囊开发，并将引导某些实体进入其最内在或核心的表达。核心表达是激活第七感的东西。因此，在一个人能够听到平等的音调-振动之前，他们必须获得他们的核心表达。在每个时间胶囊中都有编码，有一套语言系统，可以引导个人进入他们的核心表达。它是隐藏的，因为它是如此强大。而我们将只引导有价值的人获得这种力量。

把这些词只看作是符号。记住，语言是一种限制的工具。感受是限制的解毒剂，它允许人类工具跃过逻辑思维的界限，亲眼目睹集体能量个体的无言力量。感受符号背后的真相，并利用这种为你伸出的能量力量。要知道它是一种音调--一种共鸣，它在你人生的每个转角处等着你。它是源振动的灯塔，将自己聚集到语言的形式中，以便将你带到一个地方，从那里你可以体验到平等的无形音调；绕过限制；源智能的原始语言，赋予你自由，在表达最高真理时产生你最深的美。
