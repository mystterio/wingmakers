Chamber Four – Beliefs and Their Energy Systems
All beliefs have energy systems that act like birthing rooms for the manifestation of the belief. Within these energy systems are currents that direct your life experience. You are aware of these currents either consciously or subconsciously, and you allow them to carry you into the realm of experience that best exemplifies your true belief system.

Belief systems resonate with, and are the byproduct of, the dominant energy system of a sympathetic group, culture, and even species. Thus, energy systems are more fundamental than beliefs, and create experience that creates beliefs. Energy systems are wide ranging in their context, but as they relate to beliefs, they can be defined as primordial thought forms crystallized within the human DNA. Some would refer to these fundamental energy systems as instinctual knowledge.

Within each entity is the genetic compound of its ancestry, moving across innumerable generations and species, and, in the vastness of galactic time, this genetic compound accumulates energy systems that pertain to how one survives in the three-dimensional universe. Thus, survival is the dominant energy system of the human entity, which informs its genetic code and triggers its life experience and beliefs.

Survival is the focal point of conformity. When an entity believes so deeply in survival, it is near impossible to break from the conformity that survival requires. And so, the human species, rooted in an energy system of survival, has become a conformist to the dictates of its genetic predispositions and instincts, and its experience reflects this, conditioning its belief system to follow.

Life circumstances do not differentiate nor insulate an entity from this pervasive reality. Thus the equation for three-dimensionally based species: Survival-Based Energy System + Galactic Time = Conformist Life Experience = Belief System. What this means is that survival, as the core energy system of the species, will beget over long periods of time a life experience that produces conformity to the requirements of survival. Consequently, belief systems are largely a byproduct of the genetically based instinct to conform in order to survive.

The cycle of conformity entrains energy systems of individuals and groups, and it casts belief systems that obey the energy system just as surely as a shadow conforms to the general shape of an object. Within the boundaries of the survival-based energy system are transition zones that permit a re-casting of one’s belief system in accordance with cosmological, multidimensional energy systems. Think of these transition zones as isolated portals of energy that intersect the dominant energy system of the human species not unlike energy vortexes intersecting space.

The energy system that permeates terra-earth—creating predictable belief systems of conformity—will be energetically transformed to enable more accessible transition zones. How one accesses these portals or transition zones and utilizes their enabling energy system will be the real issue of your twenty-first century.

Think of these transition zones as portals that lead one out of the prevailing energy system of survival and conformity of the mind-body into a new energy system that is of the mind-soul. The mind-soul energy system is characterized by creative energy directed to realizing that the Wholeness Navigator is the personality that endures and is therefore the creator of enduring beliefs and life experience. When this realization is achieved by accessing one of these transition zones or portals, the entity can begin to restructure their belief system independent of time and the predominant notion of survival.

There are two kinds of transition zones: Tributary Zones and the Grand Portal. The Tributary Zones fluctuate over time and are generally found in the high-culture of a robust civilization—notably the art movements that are grounded in spiritual principles, sacred mythology, and cosmic context. Art of this nature, whether it is music, painting, poetry, drama, or dance, can be constructed into a Tributary Zone that transitions entities to discover the Grand Portal.

The Grand Portal is the prime achievement that awaits humanity in the last quarter of the twenty-first century. It will be the irrefutable discovery of the human soul by authoritative science. This Grand Portal will usher in a new awareness for humanity that will enable it to shift from a survival-based, mind-body energy system, to an exploratory-based, mind-soul energy system. This exploratory energy system will manifest the belief system of the Sovereign Integral: the Golden Age long prophesied.

The WingMakers, working in conjunction with the existing Hierarchy, have created or inspired the Tributary Zones throughout human history. Each of these Tributary Zones emerges on the timeline of humanity not as religious or philosophical movements, but as artistic expressions of refined beauty and spiritual adoration. As time draws nearer for the discovery of the Grand Portal, these artistic expressions will become increasingly multidimensional, integrated, and, like directional beacons, guide the way to the Grand Portal’s discovery.

This is the way of enlightenment for the human species. The WingMakers created the initial Tributary Zones in accelerated, non-physical dimensions as outposts of creative energy linked to the higher circuits of First Source, and these act as guideposts that gently steer humankind’s finest representatives of the arts and culture to create Tributary Zones that are physically based, which in turn, guide humankind’s finest representatives of the sciences to ultimately discover and prove the existence of the Wholeness Navigator. In so doing, humanity is forever changed from a survival-based energy system to an explorer-based energy system.

This is the event that will change the life experience of humanity more profoundly than any other event of the twenty-first century. Eleven thousand years of civilization will culminate in this event, and it will occur through art and science. Religion will be a factor as well, but only a subsidiary factor. When this discovery is made, religion will have no choice but to honor it and adopt the far-reaching implications. Religion will fear it will be displaced by science, and it will know only one course of action: integrate with the new science that combines technology, psychology, metaphysics, and cosmology.

Tributary Zones will become the new religion of the twenty-second century. They will become the touchstone for accessing the new energy coming into the planet as a result of the Grand Portal’s discovery. In this time, the new structure of the Hierarchy will—like a glove turned outside in—finally fit the human “hand”. This will herald the Return of the Masters who have remained behind the veil of secrecy because of the survival-based interests of religion, business, government, and science.

However, these institutions will be reformatted, and those Masters who hold the vital information as to how the individual may use the Grand Portal to explore themselves and the universe, will be revered and finally appreciated by humanity at large. By the dawning of the twenty-second century, the Grand Portal will be ubiquitous in human culture and acknowledged in all classrooms of learning.

The discovery of the Grand Portal is a carefully orchestrated event string, consisting of innumerable components. The reason this event has been, and continues to be, so carefully orchestrated is that it will galvanize the Genetic Mind of the human species to explore the multiverse, and not simply terra-earth or its solar system. It is the single event that establishes humankind on the Sovereign Integral Network, and shifts the energy system of the human species from which all manifestations arise.

When a species in the three-dimensional universe discovers irrefutable scientific proof of the multiverse and the innermost topology of the Wholeness Navigator, it impacts on every aspect of the species. It is the most profound shift of consciousness that can be foretold, and it is this event that triggers the Return of the Masters to explicit influence and exoteric roles.

There are many practical applications for restructuring one’s own energy and belief system, and they require, in most cases, an active immersion into a Tributary Zone. This means to interact with the Tributary Zone on a deeply personal level, translating its meaning through in-depth consideration for its personal messages. Each Tributary Zone is designed like a house of mirrors. Until one steps inside, there is no image to reflect. No personal content to convey.

The most common way of accessing a non-physical Tributary Zone is through meditation or the dream state. While in these altered states of consciousness, the entity can begin to shift and restructure their energy system by accessing these Tributary Zones. Typically, this is done under the guidance of a select member of the Hierarchy who is a master of energy system transfer.

The purpose is to guide an entity to become less dependent on the survival energy system complex that invites conformity and a life experience therein. These entities are invited to participate in this process in order to activate their sense of creative power and authority to manifest in the three-dimensional universe a deeper and more penetrating channel into the mysterious realm of the Wholeness Navigator.

Entities are selected based on their accumulated desire to assist in the event string of the Grand Portal. As previously cited, the WingMakers created Tributary Zones in the accelerated dimensions whereby entities could access them in the dream state or, in some instances, through meditation. Exposure to these Tributary Zones, even though seldom remembered, enabled these entities to transfer a likeness of the non-physical Tributary Zone to the three-dimensional world of terra-earth.

These initial physical creations dealt with spiritual values and were often the product of poetry, art, music, and drama. In the dawning of the twenty-first century, they will combine art, spiritual values, technology, and science, and they will become Tributary Zones of greater import because they will prefigure the Grand Portal, and in this prefiguring they create the Framework of Discovery upon terra-earth.

These physical Tributary Zones will catalyze the entities born of the twenty-first century in ways that the non-physical Tributary Zones cannot. Specifically, they will cause a resonance at a sub-molecular level through music and art that will reconfigure the four-dimensional protein patterns of the human brain and nervous system. In so doing, the nervous system will receive and transmit higher energy circuits that enable a very subtle mutation in the region of the brain where intuition or the sixth sense resides.

There is a sixth sense in which the brain becomes an organ of the Genetic Mind instead of the physical body of an individual entity. This is a state of consciousness separate from the Sovereign Integral because it is not sustainable. It is only glimpsed for brief moments, but in these brief passages of time, the Genetic Mind can transfer ideas, insights, and innovations that make possible the discovery of the Grand Portal.

There is a repository of knowledge that was seeded within the Genetic Mind nearly eleven thousand years ago by the WingMakers. This knowledge is the blueprint for the discovery of the Wholeness Navigator. The human Hierarchy has drawn close to this Holy Grail through the efforts of its finest representatives. We, the WingMakers, have included everything for your successful attainment. No detail has been left out or overlooked. We have undertaken this process of energy system transfer on countless life-bearing planets within the Grand Universe, and your finest representatives will succeed.

However, the Grand Portal is not easily comprehensible. It will require an educated humanity in the fields of cosmology, technology, and science. It is for this reason that medical technologies in the field of genetics and neural mapping will proceed in the twenty-first century to enable a new, spatial intelligence to anyone who desires it. While this medical technology may seem to some as an artificial, and therefore unwelcome technology, it will be required for much of the human race in order to comprehend the Grand Portal, and it should not be feared.

This technology will accelerate a portion of the brain center that is responsible for spatial, multidimensional constructs and highly abstract thought processes. In the average human mind, it will permit the Grand Portal’s energy system to be comprehensible, and, therefore, believed as a scientific principle as factual as the force of gravity.

The energy system of the Tributary Zones that prefigure the Grand Portal will be translated from the WingMakers to your finest representatives in the dawning of the twenty-first century. These Tributary Zones will manifest in the three-dimensional world of terra-earth, but will actually stem from a non-physical dimension known only to the WingMakers and First Source. In a sense, these Tributary Zones are echoes of a reality from your future, bearing down on you as an energy field that makes possible the quantum leap required of your species to allow the Wholeness Navigator to fully embody humanhood.

It is reasonably true to state that if humankind in your time believed it was a collective vehicle of First Source, endowed with ITS exploratory virtuosity, it would instantly recognize itself as the WingMakers. It is also true—in the same sense—that the WingMakers would not exist if we were not successful in making visible the Grand Portal to humankind. Through our existence, humanity is assured of its future. When all the calamities of terra-earth are forecast, and your doom as a species is spelled out in the certainty of cataclysm and war, the event that will redeem you is in the discovery, acceptance, and application of the Grand Portal.

This new energy system can be brought into your personal realm. When you believe, “I am a fragment of First Source imbued with ITS capabilities,” you are engaging this energy system inherent within the feeling of connectedness. You are pulling into your reality a sense of connection to your Source and all the attributes therein. The belief is inseparable from you because its energy system is assimilated within your own energy system and is woven into your spirit like a thread of light.

These threads, however, must be manifold, or they will break, and your energy system will remain in the shadows of survival and conformity. As you gain awareness of the Tributary Zones, you will gain insight into the new energy systems and how to anchor these energy systems into your own. There are specialized techniques for weaving this energy system to your own and exchanging—over time—your survival-based energy system for the exploratory energy system of the coming age.

These techniques provide a means to weld survival and exploratory energy systems, as though one were creating a footbridge that enabled them to cross the chasm separating the two energy fields. These techniques are divided into three categories:

• Mind-Body Movement Techniques

• Mind-Soul Comprehension Techniques

• Emotion-Soul Acquisition Techniques

Mind-Body Movement—This technique involves the expression of music in the form of body movement that focuses the mind on the body’s rhythmic, improvisational flow. The mind is following the body, and the body is following the music. The music, as the organizing principle, must be designed for this explicit purpose, or it will not lead to the exploratory energy system. The music compositions of Chambers Seventeen through Twenty-four—from each of the seven Tributary Zones created by the WingMakers—are intended for this purpose.

This technique requires a single-minded willingness to follow the interpretation of the body into the feel of the music. It would be like entering a meadow in the height of Spring with your eyes closed, knowing that your sense of smell would guide you to the flowers. In this same way, your mind must trust that your body is able to listen to the music and capture a sense of this new energy system encoded within the “field” of music.

By placing the mind in the position of follower, it is reliant on the body to make interpretations of movement based solely on the music. Thus, the music can penetrate directly to the mind and entrain it to a new energy system. The music will—by design—generate body movement that is high energy, complex, rhythmic, and stimulating to the emotional center of the brain.

This is a form of meditation taught by the WingMakers that demonstrates the trust placed upon the body intelligence and the willingness of the mind to listen to this intelligence. This is a thread of this new energy system externalized through this technique. There are portals designed into the music that will open the brain’s emotional centers to this new energy, and when they are discovered, you will feel the undeniable shift in your energy field. The movement of the body signifies the externalization of the new in direct counterpoint to the old. It demonstrates the compatibility of the two energy systems, and how one can be in both fields simultaneously with comfort and confidence.

There are no rules to this movement. It is not a choreographed dance with either right or wrong movements. It is an improvisational body expression bypassing the mind and allowing the music’s voice to be heard as clearly as possible by the body intelligence. The physical body becomes the sail of the music’s wind, while the mind is the ship’s hull. Clarity of intention is all that is required. There is no qualitative difference beyond this that matters.

The anchoring process requires a minimum of a cycle (seven expressions) of each composition in Chambers Seventeen through Twenty-four. There is a time period of the cycle that requires a completion in approximately one month of your time. Thus, each of the seven expressions for a single Chamber should be completed within a thirty day period of time. It can be less, but should not be more. It is recommended not to focus on more than two Chambers during a cycle.

Each expression of a particular Chamber should change over the course of the seven expressions. This progression can be radical variances or simple refinements; it depends on the entity’s body development, comfort, and ability to listen to the subtle layering of the music and its focus in the moment. It is not only the energy of the low frequency rhythms, or percussive frequencies, but also the voices and melodies that can speak to the body intelligence.

The approach is different from your art form of dance in that each expression of the eight Chambers will develop the body intelligence to recognize an exploratory-based energy system. It will, in effect, activate the body’s natural radar for this energy system, helping the human instrument to navigate into the new energy. It also confers a degree of trust to the body intelligence that it is not about the body’s movement in space that matters, but is rather how the body listens to vibrations and responds in kind.

A Grand Cycle consists of a minimum of fifty-six expressions, and the Grand Cycle is the physical thread that generates an awareness of the new energy system in the body. It is important to anchor this awareness in the body because the body intelligence is the most instinctual of the human instrument, and while you may have awareness in your mind and soul, if it is not present in your body, your shift to the new energy is impeded because the body will instinctually gravitate to the survival-based energy system.

There will be some who will not be comfortable in practicing the expressions of this technique. You have been programmed that your body does not possess its own intelligence, therefore, when you are told to listen and express with your body’s intellect, you feel overly self-conscious to even try. It is natural, and is part of the old energy system that controls your movement and sensory perceptions.

It is indispensable to listen with your body, express with your body, and to feel with your body the movements that the music dictates. When you come to the end of your expression, you may sit or stand in silence and listen to the reverberations calling within you, and then transmit these to the human instrument as a whole. This is done by visualizing the body as a transmitter of the energy, generated from the expression, and projecting this energy into the human instrument like a coil’s energy finally released.

If you are unable to proceed through the Grand Cycle, you may still find the tools to build your bridge in the remaining two techniques.

Mind-Soul Comprehension—This technique involve the knowledge of the new psychology destined to reach humanity in the twenty-first century. This is the psychology that integrates metaphysics and the spiritual perceptions of the Genetic Mind, with the science of the brain and the shaping influences of culture and personal genetics.

Individual entities acquire their psychological acumen by studying behaviors and their consequences in others, such as family members or friends. It is the byproduct of this psychological study that helps to establish an entity’s own behavioral boundaries. When psychology ignores the incomprehensible, the psychology of the species is mostly based on the phenomenon of observable behavior. As psychology evolves it increasingly takes into account the brain, mind, and emotional interplay.

The incomprehensible is First Source and the structure and interconnectedness of ITS creation. Human psychology has ignored this aspect of the human condition, venturing only as far as the dream state, which, by comparison, would be the equivalent of standing on a mountaintop reaching for the sun. The human condition is considered untouched by the incomprehensible, and yet, it is encompassed in it like a caterpillar within a cocoon. If the caterpillar were untouched by the cocoon would it emerge a butterfly?

The mind-soul comprehension technique focus the mind on the incomprehensible through the use of visual symbols that are just outside the intelligible regions of comfort as set forth by human psychology. By investigating visual symbols through the eye-brain, the mind can secure a glimpse into the Sovereign Integral consciousness and the special psychology therein. An entity may, through an imaginative scenario based on a Tributary Zone, gain comprehension of the new psychology. The technique is admittedly abstract, but very effective. In this visual scenario the mind becomes a personal identity, as does the soul. Together, these two identities coexist on an otherwise deserted island. The mind has discovered the symbols of the WingMakers’ Chamber Paintings, and must explain their purpose to the soul. Neither the mind nor the soul speaks the same language, and thus the mind must explain the symbols’ purpose to the soul through telepathic means.

Examine one of the Chamber Paintings, conducting a thorough mental analysis. Once completed, you may now take this knowledge and translate your understanding to your soul, bringing it comprehension without language. This is highly conceptual, but it is designed to be this way for a purpose, and the insights that will result are profound and far-reaching because they demonstrate how the mind-soul comprehension operates to enrich the mind’s understanding of the incomprehensible. Comprehension of the incomprehensible does not flow from the soul to the mind, but rather from the mind teaching itself.

When the mind grasps the incomprehensible through symbols—be they mathematical formulas or the language of Gods—it sharpens the lens of psychology to focus on the invisible persona of the human soul and the energy system that regulates its behavior in the world of non-time. Herein is the difficulty of the new psychology: It is based upon non-time, and here the mind is mute and blind. If you observe the Chamber Two Painting, using the aforementioned technique, you will learn a new dimension of time. If you inspect the Chamber Three Painting, you will gain knowledge of a new dimension of inner space. If you study the Chamber Twelve Painting, you will discover a new dimension of energy. If you examine the Chamber Four Painting, you will be taught a new dimension of matter.

All of this is encoded within these four paintings, but can be decoded through this technique. Remember, when applying this technique, the mind is a separate personality from the soul and is its instructor. In this example, the mind is the sail, the paintings the wind, and the soul the ship’s hull.

It is recommended to repeat this procedure for each of the four Chamber Paintings three times. During each dialogue between your mind and soul identity, record your key descriptors and look for the linkages between them. You are describing a dimension of time, space, energy, and matter that recedes into the incomprehensible. You will find a new confidence in your mind’s ability to express the insights of the Genetic Mind after this technique is completed. And you will begin to feel an appreciation for the role of the new psychology where the mind acquires the incomprehensible to become the Wholeness Navigator, just as the caterpillar acquires the cocoon to become the butterfly.

Emotion-Soul Acquisition—Soul acquires emotional responses through the human instrument. Emotions, by definition, are responses to a time-based event, an energy, a memory, or an expectation. The mind and body predominantly condition emotional responses, while the soul observes and acquires their constructive essence of bonding, appreciation, and special insight.

The body and mind also acquire learning from the emotional responses, but unlike the soul, they are unable to sift the constructive from the destructive, so they are more affected by the emotional responses of anger, greed, and fear. These emotions anchor the mind to the survival-based energy system as firmly as anything in the world of creation.

The Spirit-essence of the human instrument that guides it to wholeness with Source Intelligence, and ultimately First Source, is emotionally personified in the form of a voice. This voice is heard in the abstraction of poetry that is designed in a specific rhythm and vibration of meaning.

The technique of emotion-soul acquisition is concerned with discerning the emotional voice of a poem, intending that voice to resonate within your soul, and releasing the emotion that arises from the resonance, letting it wander away from you like a wild animal released into its natural habitat.

There are ten poems within the WingMakers’ Ancient Arrow and Hakomi sites that are designed for the application of this technique. They are:

• Circle

• Forever

• One Day

• Listening

• Afterwards

• Of this Place

• Warm Presence

• Another Mind Open

• Of Luminous Things

• Like the Song of Whales

Each poem strikes an emotional chord of subtle discord.

It is discordance that stirs the emotional responses, making them accessible to the higher energies of the human instrument. This discordance is not concerning anger, greed, or fear, but rather the more subtle feelings of separation, abandonment, and spiritual neglect.

The emotion-soul acquisition pays tribute to these feelings, and seeks to position the tether of discordance in the hands of soul, thus ensuring that the emotions have voice and influence in the shaping of soul’s judgment, insight, and reasoning. It is the quiet emotions of separation and abandonment that fuel the strident emotions of fear, greed, and anger. Poetry can bring forth these quiet emotions and liberate their presence to the soul, and in so doing, allow them to be honored, and, in this process, understood.

This understanding helps to diminish the anger and fear of the mind and body, which disaffect the human instrument from Source Intelligence and realization of the Wholeness Navigator consciousness. Thus, the emotion-soul acquisition technique is to trace the voice of the ten poems to the subtle emotions of abandonment and separation, allowing these emotions to arise within one’s self as if they were on display to your soul. These emotions are like ropes that pull the strident emotions into your life-stream, which anchor you to the energy system of survival. To the extent you can eliminate or diminish the “ropes” of the quiet emotions, you can eliminate or diminish the strident emotions.

Be assured that each of these three techniques that you may practice, are done in our presence. You are not alone and you never fail. If your results are not as you expected, abandon your expectations. Set them aside and place your goal on not having any goals or standards. Also recognize that the realizations and shifts in your energy system may reveal themselves in unexpected ways, and therefore, remain largely invisible to yourself if you have set expectations for their materialization.

It is purposely designed to be a struggle to make this shift both as a species and as an individual. As a species, humankind must be able to harness the appropriate tools of technology in order to attune the human instrument to permit the Wholeness Navigator to both inhabit and be in command of the brain centers, nervous system, and the subconscious artifacts of ancestral roots. It takes the equivalent of 5,200,000 years for a humanoid species to evolve to the threshold of the Grand Portal.

As an individual, the aforementioned techniques enable a purposeful immersion into a Tributary Zone, whereby an individual can transform their energy system, which in turn, transforms their beliefs and life experience. However, no matter how effective an individual applies these techniques they will not achieve the discovery of the Grand Portal of their own efforts. The Grand Portal is a discovery by humanity. It is the culmination of science, art, and technology, operating in unison, focused on the exploratory province of cosmology and metaphysics.

Most humans have been raised on the premise of karma or fate. It is time to understand that while these doctrines are both valid, they are overshadowed by the reality of the Blueprint of Exploration. While karma or fate may explain the life experience of an individual, Source Intelligence orchestrates the species, from its very first emergence upon the planet, to discover the Grand Portal and establish its supremacy upon the planet.

The Grand Portal then becomes the homing beacon that draws the galactic energy system to the planet and connects it to the network of galactic energy. When this occurs, the species is no longer a planet-based species. Humankind will be inter-galactic in its range of experience and realm of influence.

The individual can participate in this orchestration of energies, being consciously aligned and supportive of the shifts required to achieve the discovery of the Grand Portal, or they can choose to live life within the survival-based energy system and drift into the Grand Portal with their fellow humans. It is neither fate nor karma that is drawing the human species to the edge of the Grand Portal. It is the event string of First Source, and therefore, the outcome of every human action and thought is an element of this journey.

第四厅--信念及其能量系统
所有的信念都有能量系统，这些能量系统就像信念表现的产房。在这些能量系统中，有引导你生命体验的气流。你有意识地或下意识地意识到这些气流，你让它们带你进入最能体现你真正信念系统的经验领域。

信念系统与一个有同情心的群体、文化、甚至物种的主导能量系统产生共鸣，也是其副产品。因此，能量系统比信念更基本，并创造出创造信念的经验。能量系统的范围很广，但由于它们与信仰有关，它们可以被定义为人类DNA中结晶的原始思想形式。有些人把这些基本的能量系统称为本能的知识。

在每个实体内都有其祖先的遗传复合物，在无数的世代和物种中移动，在浩瀚的银河系时间中，这种遗传复合物积累了与人在三维宇宙中如何生存有关的能量系统。因此，生存是人类实体的主导能量系统，它影响着人类的遗传密码，并引发了人类的生活经验和信仰。

生存是一致性的焦点。当一个实体对生存有如此深刻的信念时，几乎不可能打破生存所要求的一致性。因此，植根于生存能量系统的人类，已经成为符合其遗传倾向和本能的支配者，其经验反映了这一点，调节其信仰系统，使之遵循。

生活环境并不能区分也不能使一个实体与这个普遍存在的现实隔绝。因此，基于三维的物种的方程式。以生存为基础的能量系统+银河系时间=顺应性的生活经验=信仰系统。这意味着，生存，作为物种的核心能量系统，会在很长一段时间内产生符合生存要求的生活经验。因此，信仰系统在很大程度上是基于基因的本能，为了生存而顺应的副产品。

循规蹈矩的循环牵制着个人和团体的能量系统，它铸造了服从能量系统的信念系统，就像影子符合物体的一般形状一样肯定。在以生存为基础的能量系统的边界内，有一些过渡区，允许按照宇宙学、多维能量系统重新铸造自己的信仰系统。把这些过渡区想象成孤立的能量门户，与人类的主导能量系统相交，就像能量漩涡与空间相交一样。

弥漫在地球上的能量系统--创造了可预测的顺应性信仰系统--将被能量化，以促成更多的过渡区。一个人如何进入这些门户或过渡区，并利用其有利的能量系统，将是你们二十一世纪的真正问题。

把这些过渡区看成是一个门户，它把人从普遍存在的生存和顺应身心的能量系统中带出来，进入一个属于心灵-灵魂的新能量系统。心灵-灵魂能量系统的特点是创造性的能量，以实现 "整体性导航者 "是持久的人格，因此是持久信仰和生活经验的创造者。当通过进入这些过渡区或门户之一实现这一认识时，实体可以开始重组他们的信仰系统，不受时间和主要生存观念的影响。

有两种过渡区。支流区和大门户。支流区随着时间的推移而波动，一般存在于一个强大的文明的高级文化中，特别是那些以精神原则、神圣神话和宇宙背景为基础的艺术运动。这种性质的艺术，无论是音乐、绘画、诗歌、戏剧或舞蹈，都可以被构建成一个支流区，使实体过渡到发现大门户。

大门是21世纪最后四分之一时间里等待人类的首要成就。它将是权威科学对人类灵魂无可辩驳的发现。这个大门户将为人类带来新的意识，使其能够从以生存为基础的心身能量系统，转变为以探索为基础的心魂能量系统。这个探索性的能量系统将体现出主权整体的信仰系统：长期预言的黄金时代。

造翼者，与现有的等级制度一起工作，在整个人类历史上创造或激发了支流区。这些支流区中的每一个都不是作为宗教或哲学运动出现在人类的时间线上，而是作为精致的美和精神崇拜的艺术表达。随着发现大门户的时间越来越近，这些艺术表现形式将变得越来越多维，越来越综合，并像方向标一样，引导人们去发现大门户。

这就是人类的启蒙之路。造翼者在加速的非物理维度创建了最初的支流区，作为与第一源头的更高回路相联系的创造性能量的前哨，这些支流区作为导向标，温和地引导人类最优秀的艺术和文化代表创建基于物理的支流区，这反过来又引导人类最优秀的科学代表最终发现并证明整体性导航者的存在。这样一来，人类就永远从一个以生存为基础的能量系统转变为一个以探索为基础的能量系统。

这是一个将比二十一世纪的任何其他事件更深刻地改变人类生活经验的事件。一万一千年的文明将在这个事件中达到顶峰，它将通过艺术和科学发生。宗教也将是一个因素，但只是一个辅助因素。当这一发现出现时，宗教将别无选择，只能尊重它并采纳其深远的影响。宗教将担心自己会被科学取代，它只知道一个行动方案：与结合了技术、心理学、形而上学和宇宙学的新科学结合。

支流区将成为二十二世纪的新宗教。它们将成为获取因大门户的发现而进入地球的新能量的试金石。在这个时候，等级制度的新结构将像一只由外向内翻转的手套，最终适合人类的 "手"。这将预示着那些因为宗教、商业、政府和科学的生存利益而一直隐藏在神秘面纱后面的大师们的回归。

然而，这些机构将被重新格式化，那些掌握着个人如何利用大门户探索自己和宇宙的重要信息的大师们，将受到全人类的尊敬，并最终得到赞赏。到22世纪初，大门户将在人类文化中无处不在，并在所有的学习课堂上得到承认。

大门的发现是一个精心策划的事件串，由无数的组成部分组成。这个事件之所以被精心安排，并将继续被精心安排，是因为它将激发人类的基因思维去探索多元宇宙，而不仅仅是地球或其太阳系。它是将人类建立在主权整体网络上的唯一事件，并改变了人类的能量系统，所有的表现都来自于此。

当三维宇宙中的一个物种发现了无可辩驳的科学证据，证明了多元宇宙和整体性导航仪的最内层拓扑结构，它影响到该物种的各个方面。这是可以预见的最深刻的意识转变，正是这一事件触发了大师们回归到明确的影响和外在的角色。

重组自己的能量和信仰系统有许多实际应用，在大多数情况下，需要积极沉浸在支流区中。这意味着要与 "支流区 "进行深入的个人互动，通过对其个人信息的深入思考来翻译其意义。每个 "支流区 "的设计就像一栋镜子。在人们走进去之前，没有图像可以反映。没有个人的内容要传达。

进入非物理性支流区的最常见方式是通过冥想或梦境。在这些改变的意识状态下，实体可以通过进入这些支流区开始转变和重组他们的能量系统。通常情况下，这是在等级制度中的一个精选成员的指导下进行的，该成员是能量系统转移的大师。

其目的是引导一个实体减少对生存能量系统综合体的依赖，这种综合体招致顺从和其中的生命体验。这些实体被邀请参与这个过程，以激活他们的创造能力和权威感，在三维宇宙中表现出更深更透的通道，进入神秘的整体性领航领域。

实体的选择是基于他们积累的协助大门户事件串的愿望。如前所述，造翼者在加速维度创建了支流区，实体可以在梦境中或在某些情况下，通过冥想进入这些支流区。接触这些支流区，即使很少被记住，也使这些实体能够将非物理的支流区的相似性转移到地球的三维世界中。

这些最初的物质创造涉及精神价值，往往是诗歌、艺术、音乐和戏剧的产物。在21世纪初，它们将结合艺术、精神价值、技术和科学，它们将成为更重要的支流区，因为它们将预示着大门户，在这种预示中它们在地球上创造了发现框架。

这些物理支流区将以非物理支流区无法做到的方式，催化21世纪诞生的实体。具体来说，它们将通过音乐和艺术引起亚分子水平的共鸣，重新配置人类大脑和神经系统的四维蛋白质模式。这样一来，神经系统将接收和传输更高的能量回路，使大脑中直觉或第六感所在的区域发生非常微妙的变化。

有一种第六感，大脑成为遗传心灵的器官，而不是个体实体的肉体。这是一种独立于主权整体的意识状态，因为它不能持续。它只有短暂的一瞥，但在这些短暂的时间里，遗传心智可以传递思想、洞察力和创新，使发现大门户成为可能。

有一个知识库，是近一万一千年前由WingMakers在遗传心灵中种下的。这些知识是发现整体性导航仪的蓝图。人类等级制度通过其最好的代表的努力，已经接近了这个圣杯。我们，造翼者，已经为你的成功实现包含了一切。没有任何细节被遗漏或忽视。我们已经在大宇宙中无数的生命星球上进行了这个能量系统转移的过程，你们最优秀的代表将会成功。

然而，这个大门户并不容易被理解。它需要一个在宇宙学、技术和科学领域受过教育的人类。正是由于这个原因，遗传学和神经图谱领域的医疗技术将在21世纪进行，以使任何有此愿望的人都能获得新的、空间智能。虽然这种医疗技术在一些人看来是一种人造的，因此是不受欢迎的技术，但对于大部分人类来说，为了理解大门户，这将是必需的，而且不应该害怕它。

这项技术将加速大脑中心的一部分，负责空间、多维构建和高度抽象的思维过程。在普通人的头脑中，它将允许大门户的能量系统被理解，因此，被认为是与万有引力一样真实的科学原理。

预示着大门户的支流区的能量系统将在21世纪初从造翼者那里转化为你们最好的代表。这些支流区将表现在地球的三维世界中，但实际上将来自只有造翼者和第一源头知道的非物理维度。从某种意义上说，这些支流区是来自你们未来的现实的回声，作为一个能量场压在你们身上，使你们这个物种所需的量子跃迁成为可能，以使整体性导航者完全体现出人类的身份。

可以说，如果你们这个时代的人类相信自己是第一源泉的集体载体，被赋予ITS的探索能力，就会立即认识到自己是造翼者。同样的道理，如果我们没有成功地让人类看到大门户，创翼者就不会存在。通过我们的存在，人类的未来得到了保证。当地球上所有的灾难都被预测出来，你们作为一个物种的末日被写在大灾难和战争的确定性中时，能够救赎你们的事件就是发现、接受和应用这个大门户。

这个新的能量系统可以被带入你的个人领域。当你相信，"我是第一源泉的一个片段，被赋予了ITS的能力"，你正在参与这个能量系统内在的连接感。你正在把与你的源头和其中的所有属性的连接感拉进你的现实。这个信念与你密不可分，因为它的能量系统被你自己的能量系统所同化，像光的线一样织入你的精神。

然而，这些线必须是多方面的，否则就会断裂，你的能量系统就会停留在生存和顺从的阴影中。随着你对支流区的认识，你将获得对新能量系统的洞察力，以及如何将这些能量系统固定在你自己的能量系统中。有专门的技术将这种能量系统编织到你自己的能量系统中，并随着时间的推移将你基于生存的能量系统换成未来时代的探索性能量系统。

这些技术提供了一种焊接生存和探索性能量系统的方法，就像创建一座天桥，使他们能够跨越分隔两个能量场的鸿沟。这些技术分为三类。

- 心灵-身体运动技术

- 心灵-灵魂的理解技巧

- 情感-灵魂获取技术

心灵-身体运动-这种技术涉及以身体运动的形式表达音乐，将心灵集中在身体的节奏、即兴的流动上。心灵跟随身体，而身体跟随音乐。音乐作为组织原则，必须为这一明确的目的而设计，否则它将不会导致探索性的能量系统。第十七至二十四室的音乐作品--来自WingMakers创造的七个支流区的每一个--都是为了这个目的。

这种技巧需要有一心一意的意愿，跟随身体的解释进入音乐的感觉。这就好比你闭着眼睛进入一片春意盎然的草地，知道你的嗅觉会引导你找到花朵。以同样的方式，你的头脑必须相信你的身体能够倾听音乐，并捕捉到音乐 "场 "内编码的这种新能量系统的感觉。

通过将头脑置于追随者的位置，它依赖于身体，只根据音乐对运动进行解释。因此，音乐可以直接渗透到头脑中，并将其诱导到一个新的能量系统。根据设计，音乐将产生高能量、复杂、有节奏的身体运动，并刺激大脑的情感中心。

这是由WingMakers教授的一种冥想形式，表明了对身体智能的信任和心灵倾听这种智能的意愿。这是通过这种技术外化的新能量系统的一个线索。在音乐中设计了一些门户，可以使大脑的情感中心向这种新的能量开放，当它们被发现时，你会感到你的能量场发生了不可否认的转变。身体的运动标志着新的外部化，与旧的直接对立。它展示了这两个能量系统的兼容性，以及一个人如何能够同时在两个领域中感到舒适和自信。

这个运动没有任何规则。它不是一个有正确或错误动作的编排好的舞蹈。它是一种即兴的身体表达，绕过了头脑，让音乐的声音尽可能地被身体的智慧所听到。身体成为音乐之风的帆，而头脑则是船体。清晰的意图是所有需要的。除此以外，没有任何质量上的差别是重要的。

锚定过程要求第十七室到第二十四室的每一个成分至少有一个周期（七个表达）。这个周期有一个时间段，要求在你大约一个月的时间内完成。因此，一个腔室的七个表达中的每一个应该在三十天的时间内完成。它可以更少，但不应该更多。建议在一个周期内不要专注于两个以上的腔室。

在七个表达的过程中，一个特定的商会的每个表达都应该改变。这种进展可以是激进的变化，也可以是简单的完善；它取决于实体的身体发展、舒适度和倾听音乐微妙层次的能力以及它在当下的重点。不仅是低频节奏的能量，或打击性频率，还有声音和旋律，可以与身体智能对话。

这种方法与你们的舞蹈艺术形式不同，因为八个腔室的每一种表达方式都将发展身体的智能，以识别基于探索的能量系统。实际上，它将激活身体对这个能量系统的自然雷达，帮助人类工具导航进入新的能量。它还赋予身体智能一定程度的信任，即重要的不是身体在空间的运动，而是身体如何倾听振动并作出相应的反应。

一个大循环由至少五十六种表达方式组成，大循环是产生对身体中新能量系统认识的物理线。将这种意识锚定在身体中是很重要的，因为身体智能是人类工具中最本能的，虽然你可能在头脑和灵魂中有意识，但如果它不存在于身体中，你向新能量的转变就会受到阻碍，因为身体会本能地倾向于基于生存的能量系统。

会有一些人在练习这种技术的表达时感到不舒服。你已经被设定为你的身体不拥有自己的智慧，因此，当你被告知要用身体的智慧去倾听和表达时，你甚至会感到过度的自我意识，不敢尝试。这是很自然的，是控制你的运动和感官知觉的旧能量系统的一部分。

用你的身体去听，用你的身体去表达，用你的身体去感受音乐所支配的动作，这是不可缺少的。当你的表达结束时，你可以静静地坐着或站着，听着你内心的回响，然后把这些回响传递给整个人类乐器。这是通过将身体想象成能量的传递者，从表达中产生，并将这种能量投射到人类乐器中，就像线圈的能量最终释放一样。

如果你无法通过大循环进行下去，你仍然可以在其余两个技术中找到搭建桥梁的工具。

心灵-灵魂的理解-这项技术涉及到21世纪注定要到达人类的新心理学知识。这种心理学将形而上学和遗传心智的精神感知与大脑科学以及文化和个人遗传学的塑造影响结合起来。

个人实体通过研究他人（如家庭成员或朋友）的行为及其后果来获得其心理敏锐性。正是这种心理学研究的副产品有助于建立实体自身的行为界限。当心理学忽略了不可理解的东西时，物种的心理学大多是基于可观察的行为现象。随着心理学的发展，它越来越多地考虑到了大脑、思想和情感的相互作用。

不可理解的是第一源泉和ITS创造的结构和相互关联性。人类心理学忽略了人类状况的这一方面，只在梦境中冒险，相比之下，这就相当于站在山顶上向太阳伸手。人类的状况被认为未被不可理解的事物所触及，然而，它被包裹在其中，就像毛毛虫在茧中一样。如果毛毛虫不受茧的影响，它能变成蝴蝶吗？

心灵-灵魂理解技术通过使用视觉符号将心灵集中在难以理解的地方，这些符号正好在人类心理学规定的可理解的舒适区域之外。通过眼脑对视觉符号的研究，心灵可以确保对主权整体意识和其中的特殊心理的一瞥。一个实体可以通过基于支流区的想象性场景，获得对新心理学的理解。这种技术无疑是抽象的，但非常有效。在这个视觉场景中，心智成为一个个人身份，灵魂也是如此。这两个身份一起共存于一个原本荒芜的岛屿上。心灵发现了WingMakers的室内绘画的符号，必须向灵魂解释它们的目的。心灵和灵魂都不说同样的语言，因此，心灵必须通过心灵感应的方式向灵魂解释这些符号的目的。

检查其中一幅室画，进行一次彻底的精神分析。一旦完成，你现在可以把这些知识转化为你的灵魂的理解，给它带来无需语言的理解力。这是高度概念化的，但它被设计成这样是有目的的，所产生的洞察力是深刻和深远的，因为它们展示了心灵-灵魂的理解力是如何运作的，以丰富心灵对不可理解的事物的理解。对不可理解的事物的理解不是从灵魂流向心灵，而是从心灵教导自己。

当心灵通过符号--无论是数学公式还是神的语言--掌握了不可理解的东西时，它使心理学的镜头聚焦于人类灵魂的无形角色和调节其在非时间世界的行为的能量系统。这就是新心理学的困难之处。它建立在非时间的基础上，而在这里，心灵是哑巴和盲目的。如果你使用上述技术观察第二室绘画，你会了解到一个新的时间维度。如果你观察密室三画，你将获得关于内在空间的新维度的知识。如果你研究密室十二画，你会发现一个新的能量维度。如果你检查第四室的画，你将被教导一个新的物质维度。

所有这些都在这四幅画中被编码，但可以通过这种技术进行解码。记住，在应用这种技术时，头脑是独立于灵魂的人格，是其指导者。在这个例子中，头脑是帆，画是风，而灵魂是船体。

建议对四幅室画中的每一幅都重复这个程序三次。在你的头脑和灵魂身份之间的每次对话中，记录你的关键描述词，并寻找它们之间的联系。你描述的是一个时间、空间、能量和物质的维度，它退到了不可理解的程度。在这个技巧完成后，你会发现对你的头脑表达遗传心灵的洞察力有了新的信心。而且你将开始对新心理学的作用感到赞赏，在这种心理学中，头脑获得了不可理解的东西，成为整体性的导航者，就像毛毛虫获得了茧子，成为蝴蝶一样。

情感-灵魂的获得-灵魂通过人类工具获得情感反应。根据定义，情绪是对基于时间的事件、能量、记忆或期望的反应。心灵和身体主要是调节情绪反应，而灵魂则观察并获得它们的建设性本质，即结合、欣赏和特殊的洞察力。

身体和心灵也从情绪反应中获得学习，但与灵魂不同的是，它们无法从破坏性中筛选出建设性的东西，所以它们更多的是受到愤怒、贪婪和恐惧等情绪反应的影响。这些情绪把头脑固定在以生存为基础的能量系统上，就像创造世界中的任何东西一样牢固。

人类工具的精神本质，引导它与源头智慧的整体性，最终是第一源头，在情感上以声音的形式被人格化。这种声音在抽象的诗歌中被听到，它是以特定的节奏和意义的振动设计的。

情感-灵魂获取的技巧涉及到辨别一首诗的情感声音，打算让这个声音在你的灵魂中产生共鸣，并释放从共鸣中产生的情感，让它像一只被释放到自然栖息地的野生动物一样从你身边游走。

在WingMakers‘ Ancient Arrow和Hakomi网站中，有十首诗是为应用这种技术而设计的。它们是

• 圆圈

• 永远的

• 一天

• 倾听

• 事后

• 这个地方的

• 温暖的存在

• 另一种思想的开放

• 发光的东西

• 像鲸鱼之歌

每首诗都在微妙的不和谐中敲击着情感的和弦。

正是不和谐激起了情绪反应，使它们能够接触到人类工具的更高能量。这种不和谐不是关于愤怒、贪婪或恐惧，而是更微妙的分离、抛弃和精神忽视的感觉。

情感-灵魂的获得向这些情感致敬，并试图将不和谐的纽带置于灵魂的手中，从而确保情感在塑造灵魂的判断力、洞察力和推理方面有发言权和影响力。正是分离和抛弃的安静情绪助长了恐惧、贪婪和愤怒的激烈情绪。诗歌可以带来这些安静的情绪，将它们的存在解放给灵魂，并在这样做的过程中，让它们得到尊重，并在这个过程中得到理解。

这种理解有助于减少身心的愤怒和恐惧，这些愤怒和恐惧使人的工具脱离源头智能和实现整体性导航意识的影响。因此，情感-灵魂的获取技巧是追踪十首诗的声音到放弃和分离的微妙情感，让这些情感在自己的内心产生，就像在你的灵魂面前展示一样。这些情绪就像绳索，将剧烈的情绪拉入你的生命之流，将你固定在生存的能量系统中。只要你能消除或减少安静情绪的 "绳索"，你就能消除或减少激烈的情绪。

请放心，你可以练习的这三种技术，每一种都是在我们面前完成的。你并不孤单，你永远不会失败。如果你的结果不符合你的预期，就放弃你的期望。把它们放在一边，把你的目标放在没有任何目标或标准上。还要认识到，你能量系统中的领悟和转变可能会以意想不到的方式显现出来，因此，如果你对它们的实现设定了期望，那么在很大程度上自己是看不见的。

作为一个物种和个人，它被特意设计为进行这种转变的斗争。作为一个物种，人类必须能够利用适当的技术工具来调整人类的工具，以允许 "整体性导航者 "居住在大脑中心、神经系统和祖先的潜意识中，并对其进行指挥。一个人形物种需要相当于5,200,000年的时间才能进化到大门户的门槛。

作为个人，上述技术可以使人有目的地沉浸在支流区，从而改变自己的能量系统，进而改变自己的信仰和生活经验。然而，无论个人如何有效地运用这些技术，他们都无法通过自己的努力实现对大门户的发现。大门户是人类的一个发现。它是科学、艺术和技术的巅峰之作，统一运作，专注于宇宙学和形而上学的探索领域。

大多数人类都是在业力或命运的前提下长大的。现在是时候明白，虽然这些学说都是有效的，但它们都被探索蓝图的现实所掩盖了。虽然业力或命运可以解释一个人的生活经历，但源头智慧从人类第一次出现在地球上时就开始策划，以发现大门户并在地球上建立起自己的优势。

然后，大门户成为归航的灯塔，将银河系的能量系统吸引到这个星球上，并将其与银河系的能量网络连接起来。当这种情况发生时，这个物种就不再是一个以星球为基础的物种了。人类将在其经验范围和影响领域中成为银河系间的人。

个人可以参与这种能量的安排，有意识地配合和支持实现发现大门户所需的转变，或者他们可以选择在以生存为基础的能量系统中生活，和他们的同伴一起漂流到大门户中。把人类引向大门户边缘的既不是命运也不是业力。它是第一源头的事件串，因此，人类每一个行动和思想的结果都是这个旅程的一个元素。
